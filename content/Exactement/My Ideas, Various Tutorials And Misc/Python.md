Python App with the ChatGPT AI models and More

Hi everyone

I'm excited to announce that I have just published **four hours of new content** in our course, The Python Mega Course! In these videos, you'll learn how to build the following apps with Python:

  

- App 13: SQLite Student Management System GUI with PyQt6 (Day 45, 46, and 47)
    
- App 14: MySQL Student Management System GUI with PyQt6 (Day 48)
    
- App 15: Chatbot GPT PyQt6 GUI (Day 49)
    

As you can see, we are using some cool features here, SQLite and MySQL databases, the PyQt6 library which is the best GUI library for Python, and you will also learn how to access the OpenAI GPT API to make Python apps on top of the ChatGPT AI models.

I'm confident that these new additions will provide you with a deeper understanding of building GUI apps and the use of databases. Make sure to watch these videos and practice the concepts covered.

I am grateful for your trust in my course and your unwavering support.

Best regards,

Ardit
