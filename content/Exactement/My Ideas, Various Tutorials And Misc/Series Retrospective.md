- House struggles to find out why a pianist savant is losing his ability to play. Ultimately, a decision must be made as to how much brain is necessary for a normal quality of life.
- In the end, even though nothing life threatening left (some little seizures) House asked, if the dad wants the remove the right hemisphere of the brain(it died in the accident).
- He said he's a circus monkey and he was somewhat right, even though he could play piano insanely beautiful, he didn't have a life, he didn't even have a concept of life.
- In the end, they *did* remove it however the question still remains. He gives up(unknowingly of course, but still) his ability to be someone extreme, someone rare. House also ends his argument by saying that he could flip burgers.
- Giving somebody a choice to *be* someone is always a good thing in my opinion tho this episode conflicts my view of that quiet proficiently
- It's hard getting to be somebody, giving him the chance to do something is exceptionally beautiful but he also has to basically change his identity to nothing then something
- Maybe his survival instict persevered? I don't have an answer atm tho it quiet beautifly poses a great question
