[00:00.000 --> 00:07.520]  Last time we introduced the way in which the preoccupation with
[00:07.520 --> 00:13.120]  literary and other forms of theory in the twentieth century
[00:13.120 --> 00:16.760]  is shadowed by a certain skepticism.
[00:16.760 --> 00:20.760]  But as we were talking about that, we actually introduced
[00:20.760 --> 00:24.760]  another issue which isn't quite the same as the issue of
[00:24.760 --> 00:27.600]  skepticism, namely determinism.
[00:27.600 --> 00:30.120]  In other words, we said that in intellectual
[00:30.120 --> 00:33.640]  history first you get this movement of concern about the
[00:33.640 --> 00:37.160]  distance between the perceiver and the perceived,
[00:37.160 --> 00:41.840]  a concern that gives rise to skepticism about whether we can
[00:41.840 --> 00:44.360]  know things as they really are.
[00:44.360 --> 00:50.000]  But then as a kind of aftermath of that movement,
[00:50.000 --> 00:53.560]  in figures like Marx, Nietzsche and Freud,
[00:53.560 --> 00:56.760]  and you'll notice that Foucault reverts to such figures when he
[00:56.760 --> 01:00.000]  turns to the whole question of founders of discursivity[^1].
[01:00.000 --> 01:01.160]  We'll come back to that.
[01:01.160 --> 01:05.280]  In figures like that, you get the further question
[01:05.280 --> 01:10.600]  not just how we can know things in themselves as they really are,
[01:10.600 --> 01:15.600]  but how we can trust the autonomy of that which knows.
[01:15.600 --> 01:18.800]  In other words, how we can trust the autonomy
[01:18.800 --> 01:22.120]  of consciousness if, in fact, there's a chance,
[01:22.120 --> 01:24.320]  a good chance, according to these writers,
[01:24.320 --> 01:28.880]  that it is in turn governed by, controlled by,
[01:28.880 --> 01:31.760]  hidden powers or forces.
[01:31.760 --> 01:37.440]  This question of determinism is as important in the discourse of
[01:37.440 --> 01:42.040]  literary theory as the question of skepticism.
[01:42.040 --> 01:45.280]  They're plainly interrelated in a variety of ways,
[01:45.280 --> 01:51.320]  but it's more that question to which I want to return today.
[01:51.320 --> 01:58.320]  Now last time following Recur, I mentioned Marx,
[01:58.320 --> 02:02.160]  Nietzsche and Freud as key figures in this sort of
[02:02.160 --> 02:06.400]  secondary development that somehow inaugurates theory,
[02:06.400 --> 02:08.640]  and then I added Darwin.
[02:08.640 --> 02:13.720]  It seems particularly important to think of Darwin when we begin
[02:13.720 --> 02:18.120]  to think about the ways in which in the twentieth century a
[02:18.120 --> 02:23.440]  variety of thinkers are concerned about human agency,
[02:23.440 --> 02:26.800]  that is to say, what becomes of the idea that
[02:26.800 --> 02:29.560]  we have autonomy, that we can act,
[02:29.560 --> 02:34.040]  or at least that we can act with a sense of integrity and not
[02:34.040 --> 02:39.080]  just with a sense that we're being pulled by our strings like
[02:39.080 --> 02:40.160]  a puppet.
[02:40.160 --> 02:44.080]  In the aftermath of Darwin in particular,
[02:44.080 --> 02:46.360]  our understanding of natural selection,
[02:46.360 --> 02:49.000]  our understanding of genetic hard wiring,
[02:49.000 --> 02:54.200]  and other factors makes us begin to wonder in what sense we can
[02:54.200 --> 02:56.800]  consider ourselves, each of us,
[02:56.800 --> 02:59.280]  to be autonomous subjects.
[02:59.280 --> 03:04.600]  So as I say, the question of agency arises,
[03:04.600 --> 03:06.960]  and it's in that context, needless to say,
[03:06.960 --> 03:11.120]  that I'd like to take a look at these two interesting passages
[03:11.120 --> 03:16.080]  on the sheet that has Chekhov on one side and James on the other.
[03:16.080 --> 03:17.880]  Let's begin with the Chekhov.
[03:17.880 --> 03:23.600]  The Cherry Orchard is about the threat owing to socioeconomic
[03:23.600 --> 03:28.400]  conditions, the conditions that do ultimately lead to the
[03:28.400 --> 03:33.400]  Menshevik Revolution of 1907 to a landed estate and the
[03:33.400 --> 03:38.880]  perturbation[^2] and turmoil into which the cast of characters is
[03:38.880 --> 03:41.360]  thrown by this threat.
[03:41.360 --> 03:44.200]  Now one of the more interesting characters,
[03:44.200 --> 03:47.920]  who's not really a protagonist in the play for class reasons,
[03:47.920 --> 03:51.080]  is a house servant named Yepikhodov.
[03:51.080 --> 03:55.480]  Yepikhodov is a character who is, among other things,
[03:55.480 --> 03:57.440]  a kind of autodidact.
[03:57.440 --> 04:00.080]  That is to say, he has scrambled in to a
[04:00.080 --> 04:02.840]  certain measure of knowledge about things.
[04:02.840 --> 04:07.840]  He is full of a kind of understandable self-pity,
[04:07.840 --> 04:14.000]  and his speeches are in some ways more characteristic of the
[04:14.000 --> 04:19.560]  gloomy intellectual milieu that is reflected in Chekhov's text
[04:19.560 --> 04:22.760]  really than almost anyone else's.
[04:22.760 --> 04:25.960]  I wanted to quote to you a couple of them.
[04:25.960 --> 04:28.960]  Toward the bottom of the first page he says,
[04:28.960 --> 04:30.840]  I am a cultivated man.
[04:30.840 --> 04:36.280]  I read all kinds of remarkable books, and yet I can never make
[04:36.280 --> 04:40.800]  out what direction I should take, what it is that I want
[04:40.800 --> 04:42.480]  properly speaking.
[04:42.480 --> 04:46.760]  As I read, pay attention to the degree to which he's constantly
[04:46.760 --> 04:51.080]  talking about language and about the way in which he himself is
[04:51.080 --> 04:53.120]  inserted into language.
[04:53.120 --> 04:57.200]  He's perpetually seeking a mode of properly speaking.
[04:57.200 --> 05:03.800]  He is a person who is somewhat knowledgeable about books,
[05:03.800 --> 05:07.840]  feels himself somehow to be caught up in the matrix of book
[05:07.840 --> 05:08.640]  learning.
[05:08.640 --> 05:11.880]  In other words, a person who is very much
[05:11.880 --> 05:15.640]  preoccupied with his conditioning by language,
[05:15.640 --> 05:20.120]  not least when perhaps unwittingly he alludes to
[05:20.120 --> 05:23.800]  Hamlet, should I live or should I shoot
[05:23.800 --> 05:28.000]  myself properly speaking, to be or not to be.
[05:28.000 --> 05:30.640]  In other words, he inserts himself into the
[05:30.640 --> 05:35.240]  dramatic tradition to which as a character he himself belongs and
[05:35.240 --> 05:40.240]  he wants himself to be in a debased form derived from one of
[05:40.240 --> 05:44.240]  those famous, charismatic moments in which
[05:44.240 --> 05:48.640]  a hero utters a comparable concern.
[05:48.640 --> 05:52.560]  So in all sorts of ways, in this simple passage,
[05:52.560 --> 05:56.320]  we find a character who's caught up in the snare,
[05:56.320 --> 06:01.000]  if I can put it that way, of language.
[06:01.000 --> 06:04.800]  To continue, he says,
[06:04.800 --> 06:07.760]  Properly speaking, top of the next page,
[06:07.760 --> 06:11.600]  Properly speaking and letting other subjects alone,
[06:11.600 --> 06:17.000]  I must say everything in terms of what other discourse does and
[06:17.000 --> 06:20.760]  what he himself can say, I must say,
[06:20.760 --> 06:22.880]  and of course it's mainly about me,
[06:22.880 --> 06:26.000]  regarding myself, among other things,
[06:26.000 --> 06:32.640]  that fate treats me mercilessly as a storm treats a small boat.
[06:32.640 --> 06:36.000]  The end of the passage is, Have you read Buckle?
[06:36.000 --> 06:38.880]  Now Buckle is a forgotten name today,
[06:38.880 --> 06:42.520]  but at one time he was just about as famous as Oswald
[06:42.520 --> 06:45.160]  Springer, who wrote The Decline of the
[06:45.160 --> 06:45.600]  West.
[06:45.600 --> 06:50.600]  He was a Victorian historian preoccupied with the dissolution
[06:50.600 --> 06:52.720]  of Western civilization.
[06:52.720 --> 06:55.520]  In other words, Buckle was the avatar of the
[06:55.520 --> 06:58.840]  notion in the late nineteenth century that everything was
[06:58.840 --> 07:00.600]  going to hell in a handbasket.
[07:00.600 --> 07:04.480]  One of the texts that Yepigadov has read that in a
[07:04.480 --> 07:08.600]  certain sense determines him is Buckle.
[07:08.600 --> 07:10.320]  Have you read Buckle?
[07:10.320 --> 07:14.840]  I wish to have a word with you of D.
[07:14.840 --> 07:16.120]  Fyodorovna.
[07:16.120 --> 07:19.920]  In other words, I'm arguing that the
[07:19.920 --> 07:24.600]  dissolution of these speeches with signs of words,
[07:24.600 --> 07:28.000]  language, speaking, words, books,
[07:28.000 --> 07:32.000]  is just the dilemma of the character.
[07:32.000 --> 07:35.080]  That is to say, he is in a certain sense book
[07:35.080 --> 07:39.320]  and language determined, and he's obscurely aware that
[07:39.320 --> 07:44.320]  this is his problem even as it's a source of pride for him.
[07:44.320 --> 07:48.920]  Turning then to a passage in a very different tone from James's
[07:48.920 --> 07:51.680]  Ambassadors, an altogether charming
[07:51.680 --> 07:54.360]  character, the elderly Lambert Strether,
[07:54.360 --> 08:02.320]  who has gone to Paris to bring home the young Chad Newsom,
[08:02.320 --> 08:05.520]  a relative who's to take over the family business,
[08:05.520 --> 08:10.400]  the manufacture of an unnamed household article in Woolet,
[08:10.400 --> 08:13.040]  Massachusetts, probably toilet paper.
[08:13.040 --> 08:15.320]  In any case, Lambert Strether,
[08:15.320 --> 08:20.160]  as he arrives in Paris, has awakened to the sheer
[08:20.160 --> 08:25.320]  wonder of Urbane culture, and he recognizes that he's
[08:25.320 --> 08:27.080]  missed something.
[08:27.080 --> 08:30.360]  He's gone to a party given by a sculptor,
[08:30.360 --> 08:34.520]  and at this party he meets a young man named Little Billum
[08:34.520 --> 08:37.400]  whom he likes, and he takes Little Billum
[08:37.400 --> 08:41.160]  aside by the lapel and he makes a long speech to him,
[08:41.160 --> 08:45.240]  in effect saying, Don't do what I have done.
[08:45.240 --> 08:47.880]  Don't miss out on life.
[08:47.880 --> 08:50.080]  Live all you can.
[08:50.080 --> 08:52.480]  It is a mistake not to.
[08:52.480 --> 08:58.520]  This is why he goes on to say, I mean the affair of life.
[08:58.520 --> 09:01.480]  It's as though he's anticipating the affair of Chad
[09:01.480 --> 09:04.680]  Newsom and Madame de Vionnet, which is revealed at the end of
[09:04.680 --> 09:05.240]  the text.
[09:05.240 --> 09:10.240]  The affair, I mean the affair of life, couldn't no doubt have
[09:10.240 --> 09:14.440]  been different for me, for it's it meaning life.
[09:14.440 --> 09:21.440]  Life is at the best a tin mold, either fluted or embossed,
[09:21.440 --> 09:26.320]  with ornamental excrescences or else smooth and dreadfully
[09:26.320 --> 09:29.440]  plain, into which a helpless jelly,
[09:29.440 --> 09:36.440]  one's consciousness is poured, so that one takes the form,
[09:36.440 --> 09:43.440]  as the great cook says, and is more or less
[09:43.440 --> 09:47.440]  compactly held by it.
[09:47.440 --> 09:50.440]  One lives, in fine as one can.
[09:50.440 --> 09:55.440]  Still, one has the illusion of freedom.
[09:55.440 --> 09:58.440]  Here's where Strather says something very clever that I
[09:58.440 --> 10:00.440]  think we can make use of.
[10:00.440 --> 10:04.440]  He says, Therefore, don't be like me without
[10:04.440 --> 10:07.440]  the memory of that illusion.
[10:07.440 --> 10:10.440]  I was either, at the right time,
[10:10.440 --> 10:15.440]  too stupid or too intelligent to have it.
[10:15.440 --> 10:18.440]  I don't quite know which.
[10:18.440 --> 10:21.440]  Now if he was too stupid to have it, then,
[10:21.440 --> 10:25.440]  of course, he would have been liberated into the realm of
[10:25.440 --> 10:26.440]  action.
[10:26.440 --> 10:29.440]  He would have been what Nietzsche in an interesting
[10:29.440 --> 10:31.440]  precursor text calls historical man.
[10:31.440 --> 10:36.440]  He simply would have plunged ahead into life as though he had
[10:36.440 --> 10:41.440]  freedom even though he was too stupid to recognize that it was
[10:41.440 --> 10:42.440]  an illusion.
[10:42.440 --> 10:46.440]  On the other hand, if he was too intelligent
[10:46.440 --> 10:50.440]  to, as it were, bury the illusion and live as
[10:50.440 --> 10:54.440]  though he were free, if he was too intelligent to
[10:54.440 --> 10:57.440]  do that, he's a kind of an avatar of the
[10:57.440 --> 10:59.440]  literary theorist.
[10:59.440 --> 11:03.440]  In other words, the sort of person who can't
[11:03.440 --> 11:05.440]  do that long enough.
[11:05.440 --> 11:09.440]  That freedom is an illusion in order to get away from the
[11:09.440 --> 11:12.440]  preoccupations that, as I've been saying,
[11:12.440 --> 11:16.440]  characterize a certain kind of thinking in the twentieth
[11:16.440 --> 11:17.440]  century.
[11:17.440 --> 11:20.440]  It's rather charming at the last that he says,
[11:20.440 --> 11:23.440]  because how can we know anything?
[11:23.440 --> 11:26.440]  I don't quite know which.
[11:26.440 --> 11:30.440]  So that, too, strikes me as a helpful and also
[11:30.440 --> 11:36.440]  characteristic passage that can introduce us to today's subject,
[11:36.440 --> 11:38.440]  which is the loss of authority.
[11:38.440 --> 11:41.440]  That is to say, in Roland Barthes' terms,
[11:41.440 --> 11:44.440]  the death of the author, in Foucault's terms,
[11:44.440 --> 11:47.440]  the question what is an author.
[11:47.440 --> 11:50.440]  In other words, the first sacrifice in the
[11:50.440 --> 11:54.440]  absence of human agency, the first sacrifice for
[11:54.440 --> 11:57.440]  literary theory, is the author,
[11:57.440 --> 11:59.440]  the idea of the author.
[11:59.440 --> 12:03.440]  That's what will concern us in this second still introductory
[12:03.440 --> 12:05.440]  lecture to this course.
[12:05.440 --> 12:10.440]  We'll get into the proper or at least more systematic business
[12:10.440 --> 12:14.440]  of the course when we turn to Hermeneutics next week.
[12:14.440 --> 12:17.440]  Now let me set the scene.
[12:17.440 --> 12:19.440]  This is Paris.
[12:19.440 --> 12:20.440]  It wouldn't have to be Paris.
[12:20.440 --> 12:23.440]  It could be Berkeley or Columbia or maybe Berlin.
[12:23.440 --> 12:29.440]  It's 1968-69, spilling over into the 1970s.
[12:29.440 --> 12:34.440]  Students and most of their professors are on the barricades,
[12:34.440 --> 12:39.440]  that is to say in protest not only against the war in Vietnam
[12:39.440 --> 12:44.440]  but the outpouring of various forms of authoritative resistance
[12:44.440 --> 12:48.440]  to protest that characterized the 1960s.
[12:48.440 --> 12:54.440]  There is a ferment of intellectual revolt which takes
[12:54.440 --> 13:00.440]  all sorts of forms in Paris but is first and foremost perhaps
[13:00.440 --> 13:06.440]  organized by what quickly in this country became a bumper
[13:06.440 --> 13:10.440]  sticker, question authority.
[13:10.440 --> 13:15.440]  This is the framework in which the then most prominent
[13:15.440 --> 13:22.440]  intellectual in France writes an essay at the very peak of the
[13:22.440 --> 13:28.440]  student uprising, What is an Author?,
[13:28.440 --> 13:32.440]  and poses an answer which is by no means straightforward and
[13:32.440 --> 13:33.440]  simple.
[13:33.440 --> 13:35.440]  You're probably a little frustrated because maybe you
[13:35.440 --> 13:37.440]  sort of anticipated what he was going to say,
[13:37.440 --> 13:39.440]  and then you read it and you said,
[13:39.440 --> 13:41.440]  gee, he really isn't saying that.
[13:41.440 --> 13:43.440]  In fact, I don't quite know what he is saying,
[13:43.440 --> 13:47.440]  and struggled more than you expected to because you
[13:47.440 --> 13:51.440]  anticipated what I've just been saying about the setting and
[13:51.440 --> 13:54.440]  about the role of Foucault and all the rest of it,
[13:54.440 --> 13:58.440]  and were possibly more confused than you might have expected to
[13:58.440 --> 14:00.440]  be, and yet at the same time you
[14:00.440 --> 14:02.440]  probably thought, oh yeah, well,
[14:02.440 --> 14:05.440]  I did come out pretty much in the place I expected to come out
[14:05.440 --> 14:09.440]  in despite the roundabout way of having gotten there.
[14:09.440 --> 14:11.440]  Because this lecture is introductory,
[14:11.440 --> 14:15.440]  I'm not going to spend a great deal of time explicating the more
[14:15.440 --> 14:17.440]  difficult moments in his argument.
[14:17.440 --> 14:22.440]  I am going to emphasize what you perhaps did anticipate that he
[14:22.440 --> 14:25.440]  would say, and so that can take us along
[14:25.440 --> 14:26.440]  rather smoothly.
[14:26.440 --> 14:30.440]  There is an initial issue, and because we're as skeptical
[14:30.440 --> 14:34.440]  about skepticism as we are about anything else,
[14:34.440 --> 14:37.440]  we're likely to raise our eyebrows and say,
[14:37.440 --> 14:42.440]  hmm, doesn't this guy Foucault think he's an author?
[14:42.440 --> 14:44.440]  After all, he's a superstar.
[14:44.440 --> 14:49.440]  He's used to being taken very seriously.
[14:49.440 --> 14:53.440]  Does he want to say that he's just an author function,
[14:53.440 --> 14:57.440]  that his textual field is a kind of set of structural
[14:57.440 --> 15:01.440]  operations within which one can discover an author?
[15:01.440 --> 15:03.440]  Does he really want to say this?
[15:03.440 --> 15:07.440]  This is the question raised about skepticism or about
[15:07.440 --> 15:11.440]  theory, and it's one that we're going to take rather seriously,
[15:11.440 --> 15:14.440]  but we're going to come back to it because there are ways,
[15:14.440 --> 15:16.440]  it seems to me, of keeping this question at
[15:16.440 --> 15:17.440]  arm's length.
[15:17.440 --> 15:20.440]  In other words, Foucault is up to something
[15:20.440 --> 15:24.440]  interesting, and probably we should meet him at least halfway
[15:24.440 --> 15:27.440]  to measure the degree of interest.
[15:27.440 --> 15:30.440]  So yes, there is the question.
[15:30.440 --> 15:34.440]  There is the fact that stands before us that this very
[15:34.440 --> 15:38.440]  authoritative-sounding person seems to be an author.
[15:38.440 --> 15:42.440]  I mean, I've never met anybody who seemed more like an author
[15:42.440 --> 15:45.440]  than this person, and yet he's raising the
[15:45.440 --> 15:48.440]  question whether there is any such thing,
[15:48.440 --> 15:52.440]  or in any case the question how difficult it is to decide what it
[15:52.440 --> 15:53.440]  is if there is.
[15:53.440 --> 15:58.440]  So let me digress with an anecdote which may or may not
[15:58.440 --> 16:03.440]  help us to understand the delicacy of this relationship
[16:03.440 --> 16:07.440]  between a star author, a person undeniably a star
[16:07.440 --> 16:11.440]  author, and the atmosphere of thought in which there is in a
[16:11.440 --> 16:14.440]  certain sense no such thing as an author.
[16:14.440 --> 16:18.440]  An old crony and former colleague of mine was taking a
[16:18.440 --> 16:22.440]  course at Johns Hopkins in the 1960s.
[16:22.440 --> 16:27.440]  This was a time when Hopkins led all American universities in
[16:27.440 --> 16:31.440]  the importing of important European scholars,
[16:31.440 --> 16:34.440]  and it was a place of remarkable intellectual
[16:34.440 --> 16:35.440]  ferment.
[16:35.440 --> 16:39.440]  This particular lecture course was being given by Georges
[16:39.440 --> 16:42.440]  Poulet, a so-called phenomenological
[16:42.440 --> 16:43.440]  critic.
[16:43.440 --> 16:47.440]  It's one of the isms we aren't covering in this seminar,
[16:47.440 --> 16:52.440]  but in any case Poulet was also a central figure on the scene of
[16:52.440 --> 16:53.440]  the sixties.
[16:53.440 --> 16:55.440]  Poulet would be lecturing along,
[16:55.440 --> 16:59.440]  and the students had somehow formed a habit of,
[16:59.440 --> 17:02.440]  from time to time, by the way you can form this
[17:02.440 --> 17:04.440]  habit too, of raising their hand,
[17:04.440 --> 17:07.440]  and what they would do is they would utter a name.
[17:07.440 --> 17:09.440]  At least this is what my friend noticed.
[17:09.440 --> 17:12.440]  They would raise their hand and they would say,
[17:12.440 --> 17:13.440]  ''Malharmé!'
[17:13.440 --> 17:15.440]  and Poulet would look at them and say,
[17:15.440 --> 17:16.440]  ''Mais oui,
[17:16.440 --> 17:17.440]  exactement!
[17:17.440 --> 17:18.440]  Mon avis!
[17:18.440 --> 17:19.440]  Yes, yes!'
[17:19.440 --> 17:24.440]  and then he would go on and continue the lecture for a
[17:24.440 --> 17:27.440]  while and then somebody else would raise his hand and say,
[17:27.440 --> 17:28.440]  ''Proust!'
[17:28.440 --> 17:35.440]  and then he'd continue along.
[17:35.440 --> 17:38.440]  So my friend decided he'd give it a try,
[17:38.440 --> 17:42.440]  and he raised his hand and he said,
[17:42.440 --> 17:43.440]  ''Voltaire!'
[17:43.440 --> 17:46.440]  and Poulet said, ''Quoi donc?
[17:46.440 --> 17:49.440]  Je ne vous comprends pas!'
[17:49.440 --> 17:52.440]  and then paused and hesitated and continued with his lecture
[17:52.440 --> 17:55.440]  as though my friend had never asked his question.
[17:55.440 --> 18:00.440]  Now this is a ritual of introducing names,
[18:00.440 --> 18:04.440]  and in a certain sense, yes, the names of authors,
[18:04.440 --> 18:08.440]  the names of stars, but at the same time plainly
[18:08.440 --> 18:13.440]  names that stand for something other than their mere name,
[18:13.440 --> 18:18.440]  names that stand for domains or fields of interesting
[18:18.440 --> 18:21.440]  discursivity.
[18:21.440 --> 18:24.440]  That is to say, Poulet was the kind of critic
[18:24.440 --> 18:28.440]  who believed that the oeuvre of an author was a totality that
[18:28.440 --> 18:31.440]  could be understood as a structural whole,
[18:31.440 --> 18:34.440]  and his criticism worked that way.
[18:34.440 --> 18:40.440]  So yes, the signal that this field of discursivity is on the
[18:40.440 --> 18:44.440]  table is introduced by the name of the author,
[18:44.440 --> 18:47.440]  but it remains just a name.
[18:47.440 --> 18:50.440]  It's an author without authority,
[18:50.440 --> 18:58.440]  yet at the same time it's an author whose name stands for an
[18:58.440 --> 19:02.440]  important field of discourse.
[19:02.440 --> 19:05.440]  That's of course what my friend, because he knew perfectly
[19:05.440 --> 19:09.440]  well that when he said Voltaire, Poulet would have nothing to
[19:09.440 --> 19:10.440]  do with it.
[19:10.440 --> 19:15.440]  That's the idea that my friend wanted to experiment with.
[19:15.440 --> 19:18.440]  There are relevant and interesting fields of discourse,
[19:18.440 --> 19:21.440]  and there are completely irrelevant fields of discourse.
[19:21.440 --> 19:26.440]  Some of these fields are on the sides of angelic discourse and
[19:26.440 --> 19:30.440]  some of these fields are on the side of the demonic,
[19:30.440 --> 19:35.440]  and we simply kind of spontaneously make the division.
[19:35.440 --> 19:38.440]  Discursivity, discourse.
[19:38.440 --> 19:41.440]  That's what I forgot to talk about last time.
[19:41.440 --> 19:43.440]  When I said that, sometimes people just
[19:43.440 --> 19:47.440]  ultimately throw up their hands when they try to define
[19:47.440 --> 19:50.440]  literature and say, well, literature is just
[19:50.440 --> 19:54.440]  whatever you say it is, fine, let's just go ahead,
[19:54.440 --> 19:58.440]  are much more likely, rather than using the word
[19:58.440 --> 20:02.440]  literature, to use the word discourse or
[20:02.440 --> 20:04.440]  textual field.
[20:04.440 --> 20:06.440]  Discursivity.
[20:06.440 --> 20:10.440]  You begin to hear the slight, or perhaps smell,
[20:10.440 --> 20:15.440]  the slight whiff of jargon that pervades theoretical writing.
[20:15.440 --> 20:17.440]  It always does so for a reason.
[20:17.440 --> 20:21.440]  This is the reason one hears so much about discourse,
[20:21.440 --> 20:26.440]  simply because of doubt about the generic integrity of various
[20:26.440 --> 20:28.440]  forms of discourse.
[20:28.440 --> 20:32.440]  One can speak hesitantly of literary discourse,
[20:32.440 --> 20:35.440]  political discourse, anthropological discourse,
[20:35.440 --> 20:40.440]  but one doesn't want to go so far as to say literature,
[20:40.440 --> 20:43.440]  political science, anthropology.
[20:43.440 --> 20:47.440]  So it's a habit that arises from this sense of the
[20:47.440 --> 20:52.440]  permeability of all forms of utterance with respect to each
[20:52.440 --> 20:53.440]  other.
[20:53.440 --> 20:57.440]  That habit, as I say, is a breakdown of the
[20:57.440 --> 21:03.440]  notion that certain forms of utterance can be understood as a
[21:03.440 --> 21:07.440]  delimited, structured field.
[21:07.440 --> 21:11.440]  One of the reasons this understanding seems so
[21:11.440 --> 21:16.440]  problematic is the idea that we don't appeal to the authority
[21:16.440 --> 21:21.440]  of an author in making our mind about the nature of a given field
[21:21.440 --> 21:22.440]  of discourse.
[21:22.440 --> 21:27.440]  We find the authority of the author instead somewhere within
[21:27.440 --> 21:29.440]  the textual experience.
[21:29.440 --> 21:33.440]  The author is a signal, is what Foucault calls a
[21:33.440 --> 21:34.440]  function.
[21:34.440 --> 21:36.440]  The author certainly appeared.
[21:36.440 --> 21:39.440]  By the way, this isn't at all a question of the author not
[21:39.440 --> 21:40.440]  existing.
[21:40.440 --> 21:43.440]  Yes, Bach talks about the death of the author,
[21:43.440 --> 21:47.440]  but even Bach doesn't mean that the author is dead like Nietzsche's
[21:47.440 --> 21:48.440]  god.
[21:48.440 --> 21:50.440]  The author is there, sure.
[21:50.440 --> 21:55.440]  It's a question rather of how we know the author to be there
[21:55.440 --> 22:00.440]  Firstly, and secondly, whether or not in attempting to
[22:00.440 --> 22:03.440]  determine the meaning of a text,
[22:03.440 --> 22:05.440]  and this is something we'll be talking about next week,
[22:05.440 --> 22:09.440]  we should appeal to the authority of an author.
[22:09.440 --> 22:14.440]  If the author is a function, that function is something that
[22:14.440 --> 22:17.440]  appears, perhaps problematically appears,
[22:17.440 --> 22:20.440]  within the experience of the text,
[22:20.440 --> 22:24.440]  something we get in terms of the speaker,
[22:24.440 --> 22:26.440]  the narrator, or in the case of plays,
[22:26.440 --> 22:31.440]  the orchestrator of the text, something that we infer from the
[22:31.440 --> 22:33.440]  way the text unfolds.
[22:33.440 --> 22:39.440]  So as a function and not as a subjective consciousness to
[22:39.440 --> 22:43.440]  which we appeal to grasp a meaning,
[22:43.440 --> 22:46.440]  the author still does exist.
[22:46.440 --> 22:50.440]  So we consider a text as a structured entity or perhaps as
[22:50.440 --> 22:54.440]  an entity which is structured and yet at the same time somehow
[22:54.440 --> 22:56.440]  or another passes out of structure.
[22:56.440 --> 23:00.440]  That's the case with Roland Bach, and in so doing,
[23:00.440 --> 23:04.440]  and here I want to appeal to a couple of passages.
[23:04.440 --> 23:08.440]  I want to quote from the beginning of Roland Bach's essay,
[23:08.440 --> 23:11.440]  which I know I only suggested but I'm simply going to quote the
[23:11.440 --> 23:13.440]  passage so you don't have to have read it,
[23:13.440 --> 23:15.440]  the death of the author.
[23:15.440 --> 23:18.440]  Page 874, those of you who have your texts,
[23:18.440 --> 23:19.440]  as I hope you do.
[23:22.440 --> 23:25.440]  While writing this, Bach is writing what has
[23:25.440 --> 23:29.440]  perhaps in retrospect seemed to be his most important book.
[23:29.440 --> 23:31.440]  It's called S.Z.
[23:31.440 --> 23:35.440]  It's a huge book which is all about this short story by
[23:35.440 --> 23:39.440]  Balzac, Saracene, that he begins this essay
[23:39.440 --> 23:41.440]  by quoting.
[23:41.440 --> 23:43.440]  This is what he says about Saracene.
[23:43.440 --> 23:47.440]  In his story Saracene, Balzac, describing a castrato
[23:47.440 --> 23:51.440]  disguised as a woman, writes the following sentence.
[23:51.440 --> 23:55.440]  This was woman herself, with her sudden fears,
[23:55.440 --> 23:58.440]  her irrational whims, her instinctive worries,
[23:58.440 --> 24:01.440]  her imperious boldness, her fussings,
[24:01.440 --> 24:03.440]  and her delicious sensibility.
[24:03.440 --> 24:04.440]  End quote.
[24:04.440 --> 24:07.440]  Bach says, Who is speaking thus?
[24:07.440 --> 24:11.440]  Is it the hero of the story, bent on remaining ignorant of
[24:11.440 --> 24:14.440]  the castrato hidden beneath the woman?
[24:14.440 --> 24:19.440]  Is it Balzac the individual furnished by his personal
[24:19.440 --> 24:22.440]  experience with a philosophy of woman?
[24:22.440 --> 24:28.440]  Is it Balzac the author professing literary ideas on
[24:28.440 --> 24:30.440]  femininity?
[24:30.440 --> 24:35.440]  Is it universal wisdom, romantic psychology?
[24:35.440 --> 24:39.440]  We shall never know, for the good reason that
[24:39.440 --> 24:44.440]  writing is the destruction of every voice,
[24:44.440 --> 24:47.440]  of every point of origin.
[24:47.440 --> 24:50.440]  Writing is that neutral, composite,
[24:50.440 --> 24:54.440]  oblique space where our subject,
[24:54.440 --> 24:58.440]  and this is a deliberate pun, slips away.
[24:58.440 --> 25:01.440]  Our subject meaning that we don't quite know what's being
[25:01.440 --> 25:03.440]  talked about sometimes, but also,
[25:03.440 --> 25:05.440]  and more importantly, the subject,
[25:05.440 --> 25:10.440]  the authorial subject, the actual identity of the
[25:10.440 --> 25:12.440]  given speaking subject.
[25:12.440 --> 25:14.440]  That's what slips away.
[25:14.440 --> 25:18.440]  The negative, where all identity is lost,
[25:18.440 --> 25:23.440]  starting with the very identity of the body writing.
[25:23.440 --> 25:27.440]  So that's a shot fired across the bow against the author
[25:27.440 --> 25:31.440]  because it's Bach's supposition that the author isn't maybe
[25:31.440 --> 25:36.440]  quite an author function because that function may be hard to
[25:36.440 --> 25:41.440]  identify in a discrete way among myriad other functions.
[25:41.440 --> 25:46.440]  Foucault, who I think does take for granted that a textual
[25:46.440 --> 25:51.440]  field is more firmly structured than Bach supposes,
[25:51.440 --> 25:55.440]  Foucault says on page 913,
[26:01.440 --> 26:05.440]  When we speak of the author function as opposed to the
[26:05.440 --> 26:08.440]  author, and here I begin quoting at the
[26:08.440 --> 26:12.440]  bottom of the left-hand column on page 913,
[26:12.440 --> 26:15.440]  When we speak in this way, we no longer raise the
[26:15.440 --> 26:17.440]  questions, How can a free subject
[26:17.440 --> 26:21.440]  penetrate the substance of things and give it meaning?
[26:21.440 --> 26:25.440]  How can it activate the rules of a language from within and
[26:25.440 --> 26:30.440]  thus give rise to the designs which are properly its own?
[26:30.440 --> 26:33.440]  In other words, we no longer say,
[26:33.440 --> 26:38.440]  How does the author exert autonomous will with respect to
[26:38.440 --> 26:42.440]  the subject matter being expressed?
[26:42.440 --> 26:45.440]  We no longer appeal, in other words,
[26:45.440 --> 26:50.440]  to the authority of the author as the source of the meaning that
[26:50.440 --> 26:52.440]  we find in the text.
[26:52.440 --> 26:56.440]  Foucault continues, Instead these questions will
[26:56.440 --> 26:57.440]  be raised.
[26:57.440 --> 27:01.440]  How, under what conditions, and in what forms,
[27:01.440 --> 27:05.440]  can something like a subject appear in the order of
[27:05.440 --> 27:06.440]  discourse?
[27:06.440 --> 27:10.440]  What place can it occupy in each type of discourse?
[27:10.440 --> 27:12.440]  What functions can it assume?
[27:12.440 --> 27:15.440]  And by obeying what rules?
[27:15.440 --> 27:19.440]  In short, it is a matter of depriving the subject,
[27:19.440 --> 27:21.440]  that is to say, when we speak in this way of
[27:21.440 --> 27:24.440]  an author function, it is a matter of depriving
[27:24.440 --> 27:28.440]  the subject or its substitute, a character,
[27:28.440 --> 27:31.440]  for example, or a speaker as we say,
[27:31.440 --> 27:35.440]  when we don't mean that it's the poet talking but the guy
[27:35.440 --> 27:38.440]  speaking in My Last Duchess or whatever.
[27:38.440 --> 27:39.440]  Right?
[27:39.440 --> 27:44.440]  It's role of depriving the subject or its substitute of its
[27:44.440 --> 27:48.440]  role as originator and of analyzing the subject as a
[27:48.440 --> 27:52.440]  variable and complex function of discourse.
[27:52.440 --> 27:57.440]  The subject here always means the subjectivity of the speaker,
[27:57.440 --> 27:59.440]  not the subject matter.
[27:59.440 --> 28:03.440]  You'll get used to it because it's a word that does a lot of
[28:03.440 --> 28:07.440]  duty and you need to develop contexts in which you recognize
[28:07.440 --> 28:09.440]  that, well, yeah, I'm talking about the
[28:09.440 --> 28:11.440]  human subject or, well, I'm talking about the
[28:11.440 --> 28:15.440]  subject matter, but I trust that you will
[28:15.440 --> 28:20.440]  quickly kind of adjust to that difficulty.
[28:20.440 --> 28:21.440]  All right.
[28:21.440 --> 28:26.440]  So with this said, probably it's time to say
[28:26.440 --> 28:29.440]  something in defense of the author.
[28:29.440 --> 28:32.440]  I know that you wish you could stand up here and say something
[28:32.440 --> 28:36.440]  in defense of the author, so I will speak in behalf of all
[28:36.440 --> 28:40.440]  of you who want to defend the author by quoting a wonderful
[28:40.440 --> 28:45.440]  passage from Samuel Johnson's Preface to Shakespeare in which
[28:45.440 --> 28:50.440]  he explains for us why it is that we have always paid homage
[28:50.440 --> 28:53.440]  to the authority of the author.
[28:53.440 --> 28:56.440]  It's not just a question, as obviously Foucault and Barthes
[28:56.440 --> 28:59.440]  are always suggesting, of deferring to authority as
[28:59.440 --> 29:03.440]  though the authority were the police with a baton in its hand.
[29:03.440 --> 29:04.440]  Right?
[29:04.440 --> 29:07.440]  It's not a question of deferring to authority in that
[29:07.440 --> 29:08.440]  sense.
[29:08.440 --> 29:13.440]  It's a question rather of affirming what we call the human
[29:13.440 --> 29:17.440]  spirit, and this is what Johnson says.
[29:17.440 --> 29:21.440]  There is always a silent reference of human works to
[29:21.440 --> 29:25.440]  human abilities, and as the inquiry how far
[29:25.440 --> 29:31.440]  man may extend his designs or how high he may rate his native
[29:31.440 --> 29:37.440]  force is of far greater dignity than in what rank we shall place
[29:37.440 --> 29:40.440]  any particular performance.
[29:40.440 --> 29:45.440]  Curiosity is always busy to discover the instruments as well
[29:45.440 --> 29:49.440]  as to survey the workmanship, to know how much is to be
[29:49.440 --> 29:54.440]  ascribed to original powers, and how much to casual and
[29:54.440 --> 29:56.440]  adventitious help.
[29:56.440 --> 29:58.440]  So what Johnson is saying is, well,
[29:58.440 --> 30:00.440]  it's all very well to consider a textual field,
[30:00.440 --> 30:04.440]  the workmanship, but at the same time we want
[30:04.440 --> 30:08.440]  to remind ourselves of our worth.
[30:08.440 --> 30:10.440]  We want to say, well, gee,
[30:10.440 --> 30:13.440]  that wasn't produced by a machine.
[30:13.440 --> 30:16.440]  That's not just a set of functions, variables,
[30:16.440 --> 30:18.440]  as one might say in the lab.
[30:18.440 --> 30:21.440]  It's produced by genius.
[30:21.440 --> 30:27.440]  It's something that allows us to rate human ability high.
[30:27.440 --> 30:30.440]  That, especially in this veil of tears,
[30:30.440 --> 30:33.440]  and Johnson is very conscious of this being a veil of tears,
[30:33.440 --> 30:35.440]  that's what we want to keep doing.
[30:35.440 --> 30:40.440]  We want to rate human potential as high as we can,
[30:40.440 --> 30:44.440]  and it is for that reason, in a completely different
[30:44.440 --> 30:47.440]  spirit, in the spirit of homage rather
[30:47.440 --> 30:50.440]  than cringing fear, that we appeal to the
[30:50.440 --> 30:52.440]  authority of an author.
[30:52.440 --> 30:55.440]  Well, all right, that's an argument for the
[30:55.440 --> 30:58.440]  other side, but these are different times.
[30:58.440 --> 31:02.440]  This is sixty-nine, and the reason the purpose
[31:02.440 --> 31:08.440]  that's alleged for appealing to the author as a paternal source,
[31:08.440 --> 31:12.440]  as an authority, is, according to both Bach
[31:12.440 --> 31:16.440]  and Foucault, to police the way texts are
[31:16.440 --> 31:17.440]  read.
[31:17.440 --> 31:20.440]  In other words, both of them insist that
[31:20.440 --> 31:24.440]  the appeal to the author, as opposed to the submersion of
[31:24.440 --> 31:28.440]  the author in the functionality of the textual field,
[31:28.440 --> 31:33.440]  that the appeal to the author is a kind of delimitation or
[31:33.440 --> 31:37.440]  policing of the possibilities of meaning.
[31:37.440 --> 31:41.440]  Let me just read two texts to that effect.
[31:41.440 --> 31:52.440]  First, going back to Roland Bach on page 877,
[31:52.440 --> 31:55.440]  Bach says, Once the author is removed,
[31:55.440 --> 32:00.440]  the claim to decipher a text becomes quite futile.
[32:00.440 --> 32:03.440]  By the way, once again there's a bit of a rift there between
[32:03.440 --> 32:04.440]  Bach and Foucault.
[32:04.440 --> 32:06.440]  Foucault wouldn't say, Quite futile.
[32:06.440 --> 32:07.440]  He'd say, Oh, no.
[32:07.440 --> 32:10.440]  We can decipher it, but the author function is just
[32:10.440 --> 32:12.440]  one aspect of the deciphering process.
[32:12.440 --> 32:16.440]  But Bach has entered a phase of his career in which he actually
[32:16.440 --> 32:20.440]  thinks that structures are so complex that they cease to be
[32:20.440 --> 32:23.440]  structures, and this has a great deal to
[32:23.440 --> 32:26.440]  do with the influence of deconstruction,
[32:26.440 --> 32:29.440]  and we'll come back to that much later in the course.
[32:29.440 --> 32:31.440]  But in any case, he continues,
[32:31.440 --> 32:37.440]  To give a text an author is to impose a limit on that text,
[32:37.440 --> 32:40.440]  to furnish it with a final signified,
[32:40.440 --> 32:42.440]  to close the writing.
[32:42.440 --> 32:45.440]  Such a conception suits criticism,
[32:45.440 --> 32:48.440]  and criticism is a lot like policing, right?
[32:48.440 --> 32:51.440]  Criticism means being a critic, criticizing.
[32:51.440 --> 32:54.440]  Such a solution suits criticism very well,
[32:54.440 --> 32:58.440]  the latter then allotting itself the important task of
[32:58.440 --> 33:03.440]  discovering the author or its hypotheses,
[33:03.440 --> 33:05.440]  society, history, psyche,
[33:05.440 --> 33:07.440]  liberty, beneath the work.
[33:07.440 --> 33:11.440]  When the author has been found, the text is explained a
[33:11.440 --> 33:13.440]  victory to the critic.
[33:13.440 --> 33:16.440]  In other words, the policing of meaning has
[33:16.440 --> 33:19.440]  been accomplished and the critic wins,
[33:19.440 --> 33:23.440]  just as in the uprisings of the late sixties the cops win.
[33:23.440 --> 33:30.440]  This is again the atmosphere in which all of this occurs.
[33:30.440 --> 33:37.440]  Just then to reinforce this with the pronouncement of Foucault
[33:37.440 --> 33:42.440]  at the bottom of page 913, right-hand column.
[33:42.440 --> 33:48.440]  The author is the ideological figure by which one marks the
[33:48.440 --> 33:53.440]  atmosphere in which we fear the proliferation of meaning.
[33:53.440 --> 33:57.440]  Once again, the skepticism about skepticism
[33:57.440 --> 34:01.440]  menu says, Why should I fear the proliferation of meaning?
[34:01.440 --> 34:04.440]  I want to know what something definitely means.
[34:04.440 --> 34:06.440]  I don't want to know that it means a million things.
[34:06.440 --> 34:10.440]  I'm here to learn what things mean in so many words.
[34:10.440 --> 34:13.440]  I don't want to be told that I could sit here for the rest of
[34:13.440 --> 34:15.440]  my life just sort of parsing one sentence.
[34:15.440 --> 34:17.440]  Don't tell me about that.
[34:17.440 --> 34:20.440]  Don't tell me about these complicated sentences from
[34:20.440 --> 34:21.440]  Balzac's short story.
[34:21.440 --> 34:24.440]  I'm here to know what things mean.
[34:24.440 --> 34:27.440]  I don't care if it's policing or not.
[34:27.440 --> 34:29.440]  Whatever it is, let's get it done.
[34:29.440 --> 34:33.440]  That, of course, is approaching the question of
[34:33.440 --> 34:37.440]  how we might delimit meaning in a very different spirit.
[34:37.440 --> 34:44.440]  The reason I acknowledge the legitimacy of responding in this
[34:44.440 --> 34:50.440]  way is that to a certain extent the preoccupation with,
[34:50.440 --> 34:54.440]  what shall we say, the misuse of the appeal to
[34:54.440 --> 34:58.440]  an author is very much of its historical moment.
[34:58.440 --> 35:01.440]  That is to say, when one can scarcely say the
[35:01.440 --> 35:05.440]  word author without thinking authority,
[35:05.440 --> 35:09.440]  and one can definitely never say the word authority without
[35:09.440 --> 35:11.440]  thinking about the police.
[35:11.440 --> 35:16.440]  This is a structure of thought that perhaps pervades the lives
[35:16.440 --> 35:20.440]  of many of us to this day, has always pervaded the lives
[35:20.440 --> 35:24.440]  of many people, but is not quite as hegemonic
[35:24.440 --> 35:30.440]  in our thinking today perhaps as it was in the moment of these
[35:30.440 --> 35:34.440]  essays by Barthes and Foucault.
[35:34.440 --> 35:35.440]  All right.
[35:35.440 --> 35:39.440]  With all this said, how can the theorist recuperate
[35:39.440 --> 35:43.440]  honor for certain names, like, for example,
[35:43.440 --> 35:44.440]  his own?
[35:44.440 --> 35:45.440]  All right.
[35:45.440 --> 35:46.440]  It's all very well.
[35:46.440 --> 35:50.440]  You're not an author, but I secretly think I'm an
[35:50.440 --> 35:51.440]  author.
[35:51.440 --> 35:57.440]  Let's suppose someone were dastardly enough to harbor such
[35:57.440 --> 35:58.440]  thoughts.
[35:58.440 --> 36:03.440]  How could you develop an argument in which a thought like
[36:03.440 --> 36:06.440]  that might actually seem to work?
[36:06.440 --> 36:09.440]  After all, Foucault, setting himself aside,
[36:09.440 --> 36:13.440]  he doesn't mention himself, very much admires certain
[36:13.440 --> 36:14.440]  writers.
[36:14.440 --> 36:17.440]  In particular, he admires, like so many of his
[36:17.440 --> 36:21.440]  generation and other generations, Marx and Freud.
[36:21.440 --> 36:23.440]  It's a problem.
[36:23.440 --> 36:29.440]  It's a problem if we reject the police-like authority of authors
[36:29.440 --> 36:34.440]  of whom we may have a certain suspicion on those grounds.
[36:34.440 --> 36:38.440]  Well, we certainly don't feel that way about Marx and Freud.
[36:38.440 --> 36:39.440]  What's the difference then?
[36:39.440 --> 36:46.440]  How is Foucault going to mount an argument in which privileged
[36:46.440 --> 36:48.440]  authors, that is to say,
[36:48.440 --> 36:52.440]  figures whom one cites positively and without a sense of
[36:52.440 --> 36:55.440]  being policed, can somehow or another stay in
[36:55.440 --> 36:56.440]  the picture?
[36:56.440 --> 36:59.440]  Foucault, by the way, doesn't mention Nietzsche,
[36:59.440 --> 37:03.440]  but he might very well because Nietzsche's idea of genealogy is
[37:03.440 --> 37:06.440]  perhaps the central influence on Foucault's work.
[37:06.440 --> 37:09.440]  Frankly, I think it's just an accident that he doesn't
[37:09.440 --> 37:10.440]  mention him.
[37:10.440 --> 37:14.440]  It would have been a perfect symmetry because last time we
[37:14.440 --> 37:18.440]  quoted Paul Recur to the effect that these authors,
[37:18.440 --> 37:20.440]  Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud,
[37:20.440 --> 37:23.440]  were, and this is Recur's word, masters.
[37:23.440 --> 37:24.440]  Whoa!
[37:24.440 --> 37:26.440]  That's the last thing we want to hear.
[37:26.440 --> 37:28.440]  They're not masters.
[37:28.440 --> 37:32.440]  Foucault couldn't possibly allow for that because plainly
[37:32.440 --> 37:36.440]  the whole texture of the discourse would be undermined by
[37:36.440 --> 37:40.440]  introducing the notion that it's okay to be a master,
[37:40.440 --> 37:45.440]  and yet Recur feels that these figures dominate modern thought
[37:45.440 --> 37:46.440]  as masters.
[37:46.440 --> 37:49.440]  How does Foucault deal with this?
[37:49.440 --> 37:51.440]  He invents a concept.
[37:51.440 --> 37:54.440]  He says they aren't authors.
[37:54.440 --> 37:58.440]  They're founders of discursivity.
[37:58.440 --> 38:02.440]  Founders of discursivity.
[38:02.440 --> 38:06.440]  Then he grants that it's kind of difficult to distinguish
[38:06.440 --> 38:09.440]  between a founder of discursivity and an author who
[38:09.440 --> 38:11.440]  has had an important influence.
[38:11.440 --> 38:12.440]  Right?
[38:12.440 --> 38:15.440]  Then he talks about the Gothic novel, and he talks about
[38:15.440 --> 38:16.440]  Radcliffe's.
[38:16.440 --> 38:17.440]  Anne Radcliffe's goth.
[38:17.440 --> 38:19.440]  He's wrong about this, by the way.
[38:19.440 --> 38:21.440]  The founder of discursivity in the Gothic novel is not Anne
[38:21.440 --> 38:22.440]  Radcliffe.
[38:22.440 --> 38:23.440]  It's Horace Walpole.
[38:23.440 --> 38:24.440]  That's okay.
[38:24.440 --> 38:30.440]  He talks about Anne Radcliffe as the person who establishes
[38:30.440 --> 38:36.440]  certain tropes and topoi and premises that govern the writing
[38:36.440 --> 38:40.440]  of Gothic fiction for the next hundred years and indeed even
[38:40.440 --> 38:41.440]  into the present.
[38:41.440 --> 38:43.440]  So that she is, Foucault acknowledges,
[38:43.440 --> 38:47.440]  in a certain sense a person who establishes a way of talking,
[38:47.440 --> 38:50.440]  a way of writing, a way of narrating.
[38:50.440 --> 38:54.440]  But at the same time, she isn't a person,
[38:54.440 --> 38:59.440]  Foucault claims, who introduces a discourse or
[38:59.440 --> 39:06.440]  sphere of debate within which ideas without being attributable
[39:06.440 --> 39:11.440]  necessarily can nevertheless be developed.
[39:11.440 --> 39:12.440]  Well, I don't know.
[39:12.440 --> 39:16.440]  It seems to me that literary influence is not at all unlike
[39:17.440 --> 39:21.440]  speaking or writing in the wake of a founder of discursivity,
[39:21.440 --> 39:23.440]  but we can let that pass.
[39:23.440 --> 39:25.440]  On the other hand, Foucault is very concerned to
[39:25.440 --> 39:28.440]  distinguish figures like this from scientists like Galileo and
[39:28.440 --> 39:29.440]  Newton.
[39:29.440 --> 39:31.440]  Now it is interesting, by the way,
[39:31.440 --> 39:35.440]  maybe in defense of Foucault, that whereas we speak of people
[39:35.440 --> 39:39.440]  as Marxist or Freudian, we don't speak of people as
[39:39.440 --> 39:44.440]  Radcliffean or Galilean or Newtonian.
[39:44.440 --> 39:47.440]  We use the adjective Newtonian, but we don't speak of certain
[39:47.440 --> 39:50.440]  writers who are still interested in quantum mechanics as
[39:50.440 --> 39:51.440]  Newtonian writers.
[39:51.440 --> 39:56.440]  That's interesting in a way, and may somehow or another
[39:56.440 --> 40:02.440]  justify Foucault's understanding that the texts of those author
[40:02.440 --> 40:06.440]  functions known as Marx and Freud,
[40:06.440 --> 40:11.440]  whose names might be raised in Poulet's lecture class with an
[40:11.440 --> 40:15.440]  authentic response as placeholders for those fields of
[40:15.440 --> 40:16.440]  discourse.
[40:16.440 --> 40:22.440]  It may in some sense reinforce Foucault's argument that these
[40:22.440 --> 40:26.440]  are special inaugurations of debate,
[40:26.440 --> 40:32.440]  of developing thought that do not necessarily kowtow to the
[40:32.440 --> 40:36.440]  originary figure, certainly debatable.
[40:36.440 --> 40:40.440]  We don't want to pause over it in the case either of Marx or
[40:40.440 --> 40:41.440]  of Freud.
[40:41.440 --> 40:44.440]  Plainly, there are a great many people who think of them as
[40:44.440 --> 40:45.440]  tyrants, right?
[40:45.440 --> 40:50.440]  But within the traditions that they established,
[40:50.440 --> 40:54.440]  it is very possible to understand them as instigating
[40:54.440 --> 40:59.440]  ways of thinking without necessarily presiding over those
[40:59.440 --> 41:02.440]  ways of thinking authoritatively.
[41:02.440 --> 41:07.440]  That is the special category that Foucault wants to reserve
[41:07.440 --> 41:12.440]  for those privileged figures whom he calls founders of
[41:12.440 --> 41:13.440]  discursivity.
[41:13.440 --> 41:14.440]  All right.
[41:14.440 --> 41:18.440]  Very quickly then to conclude, one consequence of the author,
[41:18.440 --> 41:22.440]  the death of the author, the disappearance of the author
[41:22.440 --> 41:26.440]  into author function, is, as Foucault curiously says
[41:26.440 --> 41:31.440]  in passing on page 907, that the author has no legal
[41:31.440 --> 41:32.440]  status.
[41:32.440 --> 41:35.440]  You say, what about copyright?
[41:35.440 --> 41:36.440]  What about intellectual property?
[41:36.440 --> 41:40.440]  That's a horrible thing to say, that the author has no legal
[41:40.440 --> 41:40.940]  status.
[41:40.940 --> 41:44.440]  Notice once again the intellectual context.
[41:44.440 --> 41:48.440]  It is a copyright arose as a bourgeois idea.
[41:48.440 --> 41:51.440]  That is to say, I possess my writing.
[41:51.440 --> 41:55.440]  I have an ownership relationship with my writing.
[41:55.440 --> 42:00.440]  The disappearance of the author, like the disappearance of a
[42:00.440 --> 42:04.440]  kind of corollary disappearance of bourgeois thought,
[42:04.440 --> 42:08.440]  entails, in fact, a kind of bracketing of the
[42:08.440 --> 42:12.440]  idea of copyright or intellectual property.
[42:12.440 --> 42:15.440]  So there's a certain consistency in what Foucault
[42:15.440 --> 42:19.440]  is saying about the author having no legal status.
[42:19.440 --> 42:23.440]  But maybe at this point it really is time to dig in our
[42:23.440 --> 42:24.440]  heels.
[42:24.440 --> 42:28.440]  I am a lesbian Latina.
[42:28.440 --> 42:35.440]  I stand before you as an author articulating an identity
[42:35.440 --> 42:41.440]  for the purpose of achieving freedom,
[42:41.440 --> 42:47.440]  not to police you, not to deny your freedom,
[42:47.440 --> 42:55.440]  but to find my own freedom, and I stand before you precisely
[42:55.440 --> 42:59.440]  and in pride as an author.
[42:59.440 --> 43:02.440]  I don't want to be called an author function.
[43:02.440 --> 43:06.440]  I don't want to be called an instrument of something larger
[43:06.440 --> 43:09.440]  than myself because, frankly, that's what I've
[43:09.440 --> 43:10.440]  always been.
[43:10.440 --> 43:16.440]  I want precisely as an authority, through my authorship,
[43:16.440 --> 43:22.440]  to remind you that I am not anybody's instrument but that I
[43:22.440 --> 43:25.440]  am autonomous and free.
[43:25.440 --> 43:27.440]  In other words, the author,
[43:27.440 --> 43:30.440]  the idea, the traditional idea of the author,
[43:30.440 --> 43:34.440]  so much under suspicion in the work of Foucault and Bach in the
[43:34.440 --> 43:37.440]  late sixties, the traditional idea of the
[43:37.440 --> 43:40.440]  author can be turned on its ear.
[43:40.440 --> 43:46.440]  It can be understood as a source of newfound authority,
[43:46.440 --> 43:51.440]  of the freedom of one who has been characteristically not free
[43:51.440 --> 43:58.440]  and can be received by a reading community in those terms.
[43:58.440 --> 44:04.440]  It's very difficult to think how a Foucault might respond to
[44:04.440 --> 44:08.440]  that insistence, and it's a problem that in a
[44:08.440 --> 44:11.440]  way dogs everything, many of the things we're going
[44:11.440 --> 44:14.440]  to be reading during the course of the semester,
[44:14.440 --> 44:17.440]  even within the sorts of theorizing that are
[44:17.440 --> 44:21.440]  characteristically called cultural studies and concern
[44:21.440 --> 44:24.440]  questions of the politics of identity.
[44:24.440 --> 44:29.440]  Even within those disciplines there is a division of thought
[44:29.440 --> 44:34.440]  between people who affirm the autonomous integrity and
[44:34.440 --> 44:40.440]  individuality of the identity in question and those who say any
[44:40.440 --> 44:45.440]  and all identities are only subject positions,
[44:45.440 --> 44:51.440]  discernible and revealed through the matrix of social
[44:51.440 --> 44:52.440]  practices.
[44:52.440 --> 44:56.440]  There is this intrinsic split even within those forms of
[44:56.440 --> 45:00.440]  theory, and not to mention the kinds of theory that don't
[45:00.440 --> 45:04.440]  directly have to do with the politics of identity,
[45:04.440 --> 45:09.440]  between those for whom what's at stake is the discovery of
[45:09.440 --> 45:14.440]  autonomous individuality and those for whom what's at stake
[45:14.440 --> 45:19.440]  is the tendency to hold at arm's length such discoveries
[45:19.440 --> 45:24.440]  over against the idea that the instability of any and all
[45:24.440 --> 45:29.440]  subject positions is what actually contains within it,
[45:29.440 --> 45:33.440]  as Foucault and Barthot, as they sort of sat looking at
[45:33.440 --> 45:36.440]  the police, standing over against them,
[45:36.440 --> 45:41.440]  that this alternative notion of the undermining of any sense of
[45:41.440 --> 45:46.440]  that which is authoritative is in its turn a possible source
[45:46.440 --> 45:48.440]  finally of freedom.
[45:48.440 --> 45:51.440]  These sorts of vexing issues, as I say,
[45:51.440 --> 45:56.440]  in all sorts of ways will dog much of what we read during the
[45:56.440 --> 45:58.440]  course of the semester.
[45:58.440 --> 45:59.440]  All right.
[45:59.440 --> 46:04.440]  So much for the introductory lectures which touch on aspects
[46:04.440 --> 46:08.440]  of the materials that we'll keep returning to.
[46:08.440 --> 46:12.440]  On Tuesday we'll turn to a more specific subject matter,
[46:12.440 --> 46:14.440]  Hermeneutics, what Hermeneutics is,
[46:14.440 --> 46:17.440]  how we can think about the nature of interpretation,
[46:17.440 --> 46:21.440]  and our primary text will be the excerpt in your book from
[46:21.440 --> 46:25.440]  Hans Georg Gadamer and a few passages that I'll be handing
[46:25.440 --> 46:28.440]  out from Martin Heidegger and Edi Hirsch.
