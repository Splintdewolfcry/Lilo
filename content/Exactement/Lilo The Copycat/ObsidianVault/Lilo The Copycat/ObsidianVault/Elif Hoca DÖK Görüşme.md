Linguistics teaches you about the rules and patterns of language. Students in this field learn to process multiple languages more easily, spotting their structures, patterns, and details

Linguistics is not about learning new languages, but more about studying their structure and rules that define them, finding abstractions and comparing the different ways they use to convey the same messages.

Linguistics, as normally understood in the scientific community, is not the study of language, but the study of _natural_ language. As such, programming languages are not part of linguistics.
