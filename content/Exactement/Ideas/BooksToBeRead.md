- [[When We Cease to Understand the World Book - Benjamín Labatut]]
Writer who has endured the long, dark night of an existential crisis, Benjamín Labatut is captivated by profound cosmic mysteries. His recent and highly acclaimed book, When We Cease to Understand the World (translated from the Spanish by Adrian Nathan West), is a genre-bending literary experiment, somewhere between fiction and non-fiction, that recounts the agonies and ecstasies of twentieth century physics using a series of interconnected episodes, each more imaginatively embellished than its precursor. Labatut presents biographical snapshots of intellectual giants—chemists, mathematicians, and physicists such as Fritz Haber, Alexander Grothendieck, Werner Heisenberg, and Erwin Schrödinger—whose work revolutionized our understanding of the universe, revealed maddening enigmas, and opened a Pandora’s box of cataclysmic horrors. This hybrid of storytelling and scientific history, which develops at a frenetic pace and then ends with an intriguing first-person narrative, is far more than the sum of its parts. The historical narrative is the crucial substrate, but the imaginative approach to the philosophical ideas that precipitate from the book’s synergy of content and form achieves true alchemy.
