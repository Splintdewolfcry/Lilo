Calculus weaves its way into the very fabric of our daily lives in fascinating ways. Just think about [**Lucius Fox**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Fox) designing the iconic Batsuit for Batman; that also relied on calculus! This branch of mathematics breathes life into our favorite animations, making them behave like real humans. **It plays a vital role in helping expectant mothers understand their babies’ gender and health.** With calculus, we can track how our heartbeats change from early morning to late evening, and it’s the secret behind reheating our food in the microwave. When we rely on Google Maps to find the fastest route to our destination, calculus is working behind the scenes. Even Einstein turned to calculus when he penned his groundbreaking equations that transformed our understanding of the world. By bringing together mathematics, science, and sociology, calculus has shaped the modern world we know today. No wonder Voltaire referred to it as **“the art of numbering and measuring exactly a thing whose existence cannot be conceived.”**
