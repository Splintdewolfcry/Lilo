- Definition Of Arguments:
	- (a) (connected) A series of sentences, statements or propositions
	- (b) Where some are the premises
	- (c) and one is the conclusion
	- (d) where the premises are intended to give a reason for the conclusion
		- ![[Pasted image 20240627200838.png]]

- Every argument is not intended to establish a conclusion that the audience did not believe before.
	- Pythagorean theorem would be a nice example as you already believe in it, it shows you how the guy got there or its about explaining the process

======

> Reptiles include turtles, alligators, crocodiles, snakes, lizards, and the tuatara.
	- Not an Argument
> World War II occurred after World War I occurred.
	- Not an Argument
> World War II occurred because World War I occurred.
	- It *is* an argument
> The sides of this right triangle are 1 meter long, so its hypotenuse is 2 meters long.
	- Also an argument because so is used there as a reason marker

- Justifying/Persuading
	- Your friend buying a car, two roles; salesman and talking as a friend
		- You're not necessarily trying to persuading your friend if you're talking to her as a friend, you would be perfectly happy if she chose something else
		- Whereas salesman wouldn't be
		- *Goal matters, you could give exactly the same reasons but for different goals.*
	- Justficiation tries to give good reasons whereas persuasion tries to change your beliefs or actions (bad arguments can do that)
	- [[Karşılaştırmalı Okuma]] Bu justification ve persuasion muhabbetini Machivelli'nin kitabı ile karşılaştırmalı incelemek çok sağlıklı olur

>Whether you succeed in persuading someone depends on what effect your argument has on that person.
	- True because persuading or convincing someone means them (your audience) believing your conclusion

>Whether you succeed in justifying a conclusion depends on what effect your argument has on the audience.
	- To justify a conclusion is to give a reason for that conclusion, but the audience might not understand or accept that reason, even when it is a good reason. Then the argument might have no effect (or an unintended effect) on the audience. One can give a reason for a conclusion, and it will be a reason, _regardless_ of the effect on the audience.

- You cannot persuade or get everybody to accept your conclusion, it doesn't work that way
	- Genel politik söylemlerdeki argüman eksikliği, bağırarak açıklama ihtiyacı ve kendi politik görüşlerini benimseyen insanlara yönelme ihtiyacı

#### [[Hata Yaptığım Sorular]]
>When people use arguments, they always intend to have some effect on other people.
	- Sometimes we formulate arguments in private in order to figure out what to believe ourselves without telling anyone else.
	- Garip bir soru ve çözümü ama bilmiyorum, bi mantığı da var gibi


- Explanation
	- The goal of explanation is different from the ones he just explained
	- *The goal of explanation is to help people understand why something is true*
	- You already start with the premise that you believe that conclusion, the guy talking about that conclusion also believes that and also explains it

- ![[Aristos Explanations For Explanation]]
- **Causal:** Explains why something happened by citing the cause.
	- Sebep
- **Teleological:** Explains why something exists or happens by citing its purpose.
	- Hedef
- **Formal:** Explains why something is the way it is by referring to its form, definition, or established rules.
	- Formal
- **Material:** Explains the properties of something based on the material it's made of. However, in some cases, additional information might be needed for a complete explanation (like with the golf club example).
	- Materyal


- Prediction vs Explanation
	- Something can be used to predict but not explain
		- ![[Pasted image 20240627211746.png]]
		- Back in the day this was used to explain the masses of planets, the formula generalizes, predicts the mass but does not provide any explanation

		- A woman that has AIDS gives birth to a child with AIDS
			- This provides an *explanation* but not a prediction, it does not guarantee that the child will be born with AIDS

	- An explanation attempts to fit a particular pheomenon into a general pattern in order to increase understanding and remove bewilderment and suprise
