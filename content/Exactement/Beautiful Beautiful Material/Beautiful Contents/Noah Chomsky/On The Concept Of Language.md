[The Concept Of Language 1989 by Noah Chomsky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdUbIlwHRkY&t=543[On) 

[00:00.000 --> 00:04.000]  The following program is a UWTV Classic.
[00:09.000 --> 00:17.000]  From the University of Washington in Seattle upon Reflection with Al Page.
[00:17.000 --> 00:22.000]  Our guest is Professor Noam Chomsky from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
[00:22.000 --> 00:27.000]  and a guest lecturer at the University of Washington.
[00:27.000 --> 00:30.000]  What determines how language in a particular country evolves?
[00:30.000 --> 00:33.000]  Why is French, for example, so different from German?
[00:33.000 --> 00:37.000]  Well, first of all, you're assuming that French is different from German.
[00:37.000 --> 00:39.000]  The French would probably say so.
[00:39.000 --> 00:43.000]  There's no simple measure of how different languages are from one another.
[00:43.000 --> 00:47.000]  In fact, if you look at the languages structurally, the way a linguist would look at them,
[00:47.000 --> 00:52.000]  French is different from the other Romance languages in a variety of ways,
[00:52.000 --> 00:57.000]  which make it more similar to German and other Germanic languages.
[00:57.000 --> 01:01.000]  There are a number of features of French which are sort of Germanic in character.
[01:01.000 --> 01:03.000]  Give us some of those features.
[01:03.000 --> 01:10.000]  Well, just to take a simple one, in all the Romance languages, except for French,
[01:10.000 --> 01:13.000]  you can delete the subject of a sentence.
[01:13.000 --> 01:18.000]  You can say the equivalent of walks to the store, meaning he walks to the store.
[01:18.000 --> 01:21.000]  We can't do that in English, but you can do it in Italian or Spanish.
[01:21.000 --> 01:24.000]  In fact, it's common Romance, because right back to Latin,
[01:24.000 --> 01:27.000]  French is the only Romance language in which you can't do that.
[01:27.000 --> 01:31.000]  It's like a Germanic language pretty much in that respect.
[01:35.000 --> 01:40.000]  They have what they call clitics, small pronouns that you attach to verbs.
[01:40.000 --> 01:45.000]  You say the equivalent of I him saw. That's common Romance.
[01:45.000 --> 01:50.000]  But in the other Romance languages, you can do things like I him want to see.
[01:50.000 --> 01:54.000]  You can do that in all meaning, I want to see him, but not in French,
[01:54.000 --> 01:58.000]  for a variety of constructions.
[01:58.000 --> 02:02.000]  Actually, there are quite a number of respects in which French is different
[02:02.000 --> 02:03.000]  from the other Romance languages.
[02:03.000 --> 02:07.000]  Incidentally, old French, middle French, French in the medieval period was not.
[02:07.000 --> 02:09.000]  It was like the other Romance languages.
[02:09.000 --> 02:13.000]  So something happened to it that made it less like the Romance languages
[02:13.000 --> 02:15.000]  and more like the Germanic languages.
[02:15.000 --> 02:17.000]  How does language change over time?
[02:17.000 --> 02:22.000]  How did 18th century French change compared to 12th century French?
[02:22.000 --> 02:25.000]  When we talk about language change, that's very misleading.
[02:25.000 --> 02:28.000]  There is no such thing as a language in France.
[02:28.000 --> 02:33.000]  Up until the turn of the century, you could find people in nearby villages in France
[02:33.000 --> 02:36.000]  who couldn't understand one, virtually could not understand one another.
[02:36.000 --> 02:40.000]  The idea of a national language is a pretty modern phenomenon.
[02:40.000 --> 02:43.000]  It has to do with the rise of nationalism and communication and so on,
[02:43.000 --> 02:47.000]  or take, say, Italy today or Germany today.
[02:47.000 --> 02:52.000]  I mean, the differences among the things that we call German are enormous,
[02:52.000 --> 02:55.000]  so enormous as to lead to non-mutual intelligibility.
[02:55.000 --> 02:58.000]  You have to learn the national language when you go to school.
[02:58.000 --> 03:01.000]  It's a different language than the one you spoke at home.
[03:01.000 --> 03:06.000]  And when we talk about language changing, what's actually happening is that there's some,
[03:06.000 --> 03:07.000]  it's kind of like species changing.
[03:07.000 --> 03:14.000]  There's a mixture of all sorts of dialects, and the mix changes over time,
[03:14.000 --> 03:20.000]  either because of conquest or some political change or boundaries are drawn in a different place
[03:20.000 --> 03:23.000]  or some kind of commercial interchange or whatever.
[03:23.000 --> 03:28.000]  The mixture of these things changes over time, and you take a look at it a few centuries apart,
[03:28.000 --> 03:30.000]  it looks like there's a different language.
[03:30.000 --> 03:34.000]  But what's happened is, what happens is that between generations,
[03:34.000 --> 03:40.000]  there are usually small changes having to do with other influences from the outside and so on,
[03:40.000 --> 03:42.000]  and these things are cumulative.
[03:42.000 --> 03:44.000]  Sometimes they lead to pretty dramatic changes.
[03:44.000 --> 03:48.000]  I mean, within a couple of generations, the language can have a,
[03:48.000 --> 03:51.000]  can change structurally in quite dramatic ways.
[03:51.000 --> 03:54.000]  And of course, in, say, lexicon, you know, the words of the language,
[03:54.000 --> 03:56.000]  well, that's a different matter altogether.
[03:56.000 --> 04:00.000]  So when technology develops, you get a whole new vocabulary.
[04:00.000 --> 04:05.000]  But if you were in France in the 12th century and you understood all the nuances of language,
[04:05.000 --> 04:10.000]  could you have predicted how these various languages would have evolved over time?
[04:10.000 --> 04:12.000]  No, it's totally impossible.
[04:12.000 --> 04:14.000]  But is it partially random?
[04:14.000 --> 04:16.000]  It's not so much that it's random.
[04:16.000 --> 04:17.000]  It's not actually random.
[04:17.000 --> 04:19.000]  For all we know, it might be completely deterministic.
[04:19.000 --> 04:21.000]  There's just too many factors involved.
[04:21.000 --> 04:23.000]  It's like predicting the weather.
[04:23.000 --> 04:25.000]  There's just too many things going on.
[04:25.000 --> 04:28.000]  The human life is a pretty complicated affair.
[04:28.000 --> 04:31.000]  And now culture, our culture is,
[04:31.000 --> 04:34.000]  speakers of English can be misled by this.
[04:34.000 --> 04:37.000]  English is relatively homogeneous.
[04:37.000 --> 04:39.000]  <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">You can go a long way in the United States.</mark>
[04:39.000 --> 04:41.000]  You know, I mean, I just came from Boston,
[04:41.000 --> 04:45.000]  and I understand everybody in Portland and Seattle and so on.
[04:45.000 --> 04:47.000]  But that's not true of most of the world.
[04:47.000 --> 04:51.000]  Most of the world, language areas, language,
[04:51.000 --> 04:54.000]  you can get very different languages pretty close by.
[04:54.000 --> 04:57.000]  And much of the world is what we would call multilingual.
[04:57.000 --> 05:00.000]  The closer I get to the border between France and Germany,
[05:00.000 --> 05:02.000]  the closer the language has become.
[05:02.000 --> 05:05.000]  Yeah, well, in particular, if you go from, say, Paris to Rome,
[05:05.000 --> 05:07.000]  as you go toward the Italian border,
[05:07.000 --> 05:10.000]  it starts to sound more like Italian.
[05:10.000 --> 05:13.000]  And at some point, it becomes Italian.
[05:13.000 --> 05:16.000]  And there isn't, in fact, I mean, by now,
[05:16.000 --> 05:19.000]  there's enough national unity and so on
[05:19.000 --> 05:20.000]  so you can really find the border.
[05:20.000 --> 05:22.000]  But if you go back a little ways, there was no border.
[05:22.000 --> 05:25.000]  There was just, I wouldn't say continuum.
[05:25.000 --> 05:28.000]  There were just constant changes and fluctuations and variations.
[05:28.000 --> 05:32.000]  And you started speaking one thing in one place,
[05:32.000 --> 05:33.000]  another thing in another place,
[05:33.000 --> 05:35.000]  and they're not mutually intelligible often.
[05:35.000 --> 05:37.000]  But along the way, there are just all sorts of changes.
[05:37.000 --> 05:40.000]  Now, with the rise of national states,
[05:40.000 --> 05:42.000]  and especially national communications
[05:42.000 --> 05:45.000]  and national education systems and all of these things,
[05:45.000 --> 05:47.000]  which is a pretty modern phenomenon,
[05:47.000 --> 05:50.000]  then you get what we call national languages.
[05:50.000 --> 05:53.000]  Now, as I say, English is unusual.
[05:53.000 --> 05:56.000]  The reason, if you go to pre-colonial times,
[05:56.000 --> 05:59.000]  there were just hundreds of thousands probably
[05:59.000 --> 06:03.000]  of different languages spoken in what's now called the United States.
[06:03.000 --> 06:07.000]  Well, through the destruction of the indigenous population,
[06:07.000 --> 06:11.000]  and it was real destruction, kind of genocidal,
[06:11.000 --> 06:16.000]  and the conquest by speakers of basically one group,
[06:16.000 --> 06:19.000]  you ended up having a large homogeneous language.
[06:19.000 --> 06:21.000]  But how could anybody have predicted that?
[06:21.000 --> 06:23.000]  I mean, it had to do with the invention of guns
[06:23.000 --> 06:26.000]  and, you know, political conquest and all sorts of things.
[06:26.000 --> 06:28.000]  And that's pretty much what human history is.
[06:28.000 --> 06:30.000]  There are some French theorists, for example,
[06:30.000 --> 06:32.000]  who argue that they must work very hard
[06:32.000 --> 06:34.000]  to keep the French language pure.
[06:34.000 --> 06:35.000]  What does that mean?
[06:35.000 --> 06:37.000]  It doesn't mean anything.
[06:37.000 --> 06:39.000]  I mean, there's an old...
[06:39.000 --> 06:41.000]  I mean, virtually every national language,
[06:41.000 --> 06:43.000]  every national culture,
[06:43.000 --> 06:45.000]  or at least the European ones, maybe others,
[06:45.000 --> 06:50.000]  has a mythology that that's the only real pure language
[06:50.000 --> 06:52.000]  and all the others are corrupt.
[06:52.000 --> 06:56.000]  In France, this position is kind of extreme.
[06:56.000 --> 06:58.000]  In fact, if you go back to its origins,
[06:58.000 --> 07:00.000]  it's even a little bit comical.
[07:00.000 --> 07:02.000]  I don't know if anybody's actually studied it.
[07:02.000 --> 07:04.000]  But if you go back to, say, the 18th century
[07:04.000 --> 07:06.000]  and you read, say, Diderot,
[07:06.000 --> 07:10.000]  he explains Diderot very, you know, seriously,
[07:10.000 --> 07:12.000]  that he says...
[07:12.000 --> 07:14.000]  Here's a prediction for you.
[07:14.000 --> 07:17.000]  He says, France is going to be the language of science,
[07:17.000 --> 07:21.000]  and German and English will be the languages of literature.
[07:21.000 --> 07:25.000]  And the reason for this is that French is very clear.
[07:25.000 --> 07:28.000]  In France, the words follow the order of the thoughts,
[07:28.000 --> 07:31.000]  whereas if you listen to German and English,
[07:31.000 --> 07:33.000]  the words don't quite follow the words of the thought.
[07:33.000 --> 07:35.000]  So France is good for telling...
[07:35.000 --> 07:37.000]  French is good for telling the truth
[07:37.000 --> 07:39.000]  because of its, what later came to be called,
[07:39.000 --> 07:41.000]  its Gallic lucidity and clarity,
[07:41.000 --> 07:43.000]  whereas German and...
[07:43.000 --> 07:45.000]  I think his examples were German and English,
[07:45.000 --> 07:47.000]  maybe Italian.
[07:47.000 --> 07:51.000]  They're good languages for telling fantasies and falsehoods,
[07:51.000 --> 07:53.000]  so they'll be the languages of literature.
[07:53.000 --> 07:55.000]  Now, it's a sort of naive point of view,
[07:55.000 --> 07:57.000]  but you can see what was going on in his head.
[07:57.000 --> 07:59.000]  I mean, for him, the words in French
[07:59.000 --> 08:01.000]  followed the order of thoughts.
[08:01.000 --> 08:03.000]  When you hear German, it seems all confused.
[08:03.000 --> 08:05.000]  I mean, thinking in some other way.
[08:05.000 --> 08:08.000]  The speaker of German looks the opposite, of course.
[08:08.000 --> 08:12.000]  And I suspect that the mythology
[08:12.000 --> 08:17.000]  of the purity and lucidity and clarity of French
[08:17.000 --> 08:20.000]  goes back to ideas of that kind.
[08:20.000 --> 08:23.000]  After all, French culture had a certain dominance
[08:23.000 --> 08:25.000]  and appeal for a long time,
[08:25.000 --> 08:27.000]  so these attitudes get established.
[08:27.000 --> 08:29.000]  But what does it mean for the language to be pure?
[08:29.000 --> 08:31.000]  Or when people say they want English to be pure,
[08:31.000 --> 08:33.000]  what are they talking about?
[08:33.000 --> 08:35.000]  Was Shakespeare pure?
[08:35.000 --> 08:38.000]  In fact, every stage of history, languages are...
[08:38.000 --> 08:40.000]  First of all, there is no such thing as a language.
[08:40.000 --> 08:42.000]  There are just lots of different ways of speaking
[08:42.000 --> 08:44.000]  that different people have,
[08:44.000 --> 08:46.000]  which are more or less similar to one another,
[08:46.000 --> 08:50.000]  and some of them may have prestige associated with them.
[08:50.000 --> 08:53.000]  For example, some of them may be the speech
[08:53.000 --> 08:55.000]  of a conquering group or a wealthy group
[08:55.000 --> 08:59.000]  or a priestly caste or one thing or another,
[08:59.000 --> 09:02.000]  and we may decide, okay, those are the good ones,
[09:02.000 --> 09:04.000]  and some other one is the bad one.
[09:04.000 --> 09:07.000]  But if social and political relations reversed,
[09:07.000 --> 09:09.000]  we'd make the opposite conclusions.
[09:09.000 --> 09:11.000]  Let's say, take black English today.
[09:11.000 --> 09:15.000]  Black English is considered not quite proper English.
[09:15.000 --> 09:18.000]  On the other hand, if blacks happen to have all the power
[09:18.000 --> 09:20.000]  and own all the corporations
[09:20.000 --> 09:22.000]  and whites were working for them,
[09:22.000 --> 09:24.000]  it would be the other way around.
[09:24.000 --> 09:26.000]  Black English would be the language of culture and science
[09:26.000 --> 09:28.000]  and so on, and the stuff that you and I speak
[09:28.000 --> 09:30.000]  would be considered a degenerate dialect,
[09:30.000 --> 09:32.000]  which you have to get people out of
[09:32.000 --> 09:34.000]  so that they'll be able to think.
[09:34.000 --> 09:36.000]  But that raises an interesting question.
[09:36.000 --> 09:38.000]  Why does language have rules?
[09:38.000 --> 09:40.000]  Why is bad grammar bad grammar?
[09:40.000 --> 09:43.000]  Well, when you're taught rules of your own language
[09:43.000 --> 09:46.000]  in grade school, the chances are very strong
[09:46.000 --> 09:48.000]  that what you're being taught is false.
[09:48.000 --> 09:50.000]  Otherwise, you wouldn't have to be taught it.
[09:50.000 --> 09:52.000]  But I can see every grade school teacher
[09:52.000 --> 09:54.000]  about to throw an orange at you on the screen.
[09:54.000 --> 09:58.000]  Well, we have to be a little more nuanced.
[09:58.000 --> 10:00.000]  One of the things you learn in grade school
[10:00.000 --> 10:02.000]  is the literary language.
[10:02.000 --> 10:04.000]  Now, in English, the literary standard
[10:04.000 --> 10:06.000]  is not so radically different
[10:06.000 --> 10:08.000]  from what, say, you and I grew up with,
[10:08.000 --> 10:10.000]  but it's somewhat different.
[10:10.000 --> 10:12.000]  The literary standard is not
[10:12.000 --> 10:14.000]  what I learned in the streets.
[10:14.000 --> 10:16.000]  It's not very different, but it's a little different.
[10:16.000 --> 10:18.000]  And when I went to school,
[10:18.000 --> 10:20.000]  I was taught the literary standard.
[10:20.000 --> 10:22.000]  Now, the literary standard has
[10:22.000 --> 10:24.000]  some principles associated with it,
[10:24.000 --> 10:26.000]  some of which are those of a real language,
[10:26.000 --> 10:28.000]  some of which are completely artificial.
[10:28.000 --> 10:30.000]  They were made up by people
[10:30.000 --> 10:32.000]  who had crazy ideas about language.
[10:32.000 --> 10:34.000]  And they're all given names you'd never heard of before.
[10:34.000 --> 10:36.000]  The reason you have to teach them
[10:36.000 --> 10:38.000]  is because they are not the person's language.
[10:38.000 --> 10:40.000]  Your actual language, nobody teaches you.
[10:40.000 --> 10:42.000]  I mean, your language just grows in your head.
[10:42.000 --> 10:44.000]  You know, you can't...
[10:44.000 --> 10:46.000]  You stick a young child in an environment
[10:46.000 --> 10:48.000]  where people are speaking language,
[10:48.000 --> 10:50.000]  and that child can no more
[10:50.000 --> 10:52.000]  help knowing that language
[10:52.000 --> 10:54.000]  than the child can help growing.
[10:54.000 --> 10:56.000]  It's just part of human growth
[10:56.000 --> 10:58.000]  is for some component of the brain
[10:58.000 --> 11:00.000]  to pick up the language.
[11:00.000 --> 11:02.000]  You can't learn it, and you don't learn it
[11:02.000 --> 11:04.000]  until you learn to see.
[11:04.000 --> 11:06.000]  Now, the fact is that the system
[11:06.000 --> 11:08.000]  that grows in the brain
[11:08.000 --> 11:10.000]  is sometimes different
[11:10.000 --> 11:12.000]  from a system which is
[11:12.000 --> 11:14.000]  regarded, for whatever reason,
[11:14.000 --> 11:16.000]  as necessary or appropriate
[11:16.000 --> 11:18.000]  or approved
[11:18.000 --> 11:20.000]  or something.
[11:20.000 --> 11:22.000]  There's some prestige dialect,
[11:22.000 --> 11:24.000]  and it may be different from what grew in your brain.
[11:24.000 --> 11:26.000]  It typically is.
[11:26.000 --> 11:28.000]  Or it may be a way of trying to get us to have a common bond through language.
[11:28.000 --> 11:30.000]  Well, it's possible.
[11:30.000 --> 11:32.000]  I mean, I think that's a problem
[11:32.000 --> 11:34.000]  in places like, say, Italy.
[11:34.000 --> 11:36.000]  In Italy, when you...
[11:36.000 --> 11:38.000]  If somebody grows up in the Piedmont area
[11:38.000 --> 11:40.000]  and somebody else grows up in the
[11:40.000 --> 11:42.000]  Naples area,
[11:42.000 --> 11:44.000]  they speak totally different languages.
[11:44.000 --> 11:46.000]  Neither can understand a word the other's saying.
[11:46.000 --> 11:48.000]  So there,
[11:48.000 --> 11:50.000]  when you teach what they call
[11:50.000 --> 11:52.000]  Italian, which is the language roughly
[11:52.000 --> 11:54.000]  of the area of Florence, of Tuscany,
[11:54.000 --> 11:56.000]  you're teaching people what amounts to a second language.
[11:56.000 --> 11:58.000]  And it's the national language.
[11:58.000 --> 12:00.000]  The same is true in Germany and...
[12:00.000 --> 12:02.000]  China.
[12:02.000 --> 12:04.000]  Well, China is even worse, because what we call Chinese
[12:04.000 --> 12:06.000]  is a set of languages which are as different
[12:06.000 --> 12:08.000]  from one another as the different
[12:08.000 --> 12:10.000]  Romance languages. They just happen to be all yellow
[12:10.000 --> 12:12.000]  on the map or something, and they happen to be
[12:12.000 --> 12:14.000]  a unified political area.
[12:14.000 --> 12:16.000]  But there's no sense in which they're the same language.
[12:16.000 --> 12:18.000]  We call them Chinese dialects.
[12:18.000 --> 12:20.000]  But that would be like calling
[12:20.000 --> 12:22.000]  French and Romanian two different dialects
[12:22.000 --> 12:24.000]  of the same language, Latin or something.
[12:24.000 --> 12:26.000]  I mean, these terms have no
[12:26.000 --> 12:28.000]  linguistic meaning. They have only
[12:28.000 --> 12:30.000]  sociopolitical meaning of a very
[12:30.000 --> 12:32.000]  complex sort.
[12:32.000 --> 12:34.000]  And the way in which they interact
[12:34.000 --> 12:36.000]  with authority structures is crucial.
[12:36.000 --> 12:38.000]  So what we call good English
[12:38.000 --> 12:40.000]  is a system which is
[12:40.000 --> 12:42.000]  partly artificial, I should say,
[12:42.000 --> 12:44.000]  which is taught to people
[12:44.000 --> 12:46.000]  because it was legislated to be good English.
[12:46.000 --> 12:48.000]  Now some of what it's taught
[12:48.000 --> 12:50.000]  breaks the rules of any
[12:50.000 --> 12:52.000]  conceivable human language. That's why it has to be
[12:52.000 --> 12:54.000]  taught over and over again. So I don't
[12:54.000 --> 12:56.000]  know if people still do it in school, but when I was
[12:56.000 --> 12:58.000]  in school, you had to learn all sorts
[12:58.000 --> 13:00.000]  of complicated nonsense about shall
[13:00.000 --> 13:02.000]  and will, which nobody could ever remember.
[13:02.000 --> 13:04.000]  I mean, I forget what it worked. I shall,
[13:04.000 --> 13:06.000]  you will, or some strange thing.
[13:06.000 --> 13:08.000]  That violates...
[13:08.000 --> 13:10.000]  There are certain principles
[13:10.000 --> 13:12.000]  of human biology which determine
[13:12.000 --> 13:14.000]  what a language can be, and no language can be
[13:14.000 --> 13:16.000]  like that. So that had to be...
[13:16.000 --> 13:18.000]  In fact, you can trace that back and you can find out
[13:18.000 --> 13:20.000]  who invented it. You know, some bishop in the 17th
[13:20.000 --> 13:22.000]  century or something invented it and decided that's
[13:22.000 --> 13:24.000]  the way it's supposed to be. Now that kind of thing, of course,
[13:24.000 --> 13:26.000]  has to be taught because it's totally artificial.
[13:26.000 --> 13:28.000]  Or you have to teach people how to say
[13:30.000 --> 13:32.000]  he and I instead of
[13:32.000 --> 13:34.000]  him and me. Well, English sort of works
[13:34.000 --> 13:36.000]  the other way. I mean, if nobody was bothering you
[13:36.000 --> 13:38.000]  in English, you'd probably say him and me
[13:38.000 --> 13:40.000]  or here or something like that. But you're
[13:40.000 --> 13:42.000]  taught in the standard language not to do
[13:42.000 --> 13:44.000]  that. There's some other invented
[13:44.000 --> 13:46.000]  language which is called the literary standard in which
[13:46.000 --> 13:48.000]  you don't do it. And you ask the question
[13:48.000 --> 13:50.000]  why do you have to teach people?
[13:50.000 --> 13:52.000]  Well, you have to teach them because it's artificial. It's not
[13:52.000 --> 13:54.000]  their language. And often it's not just
[13:54.000 --> 13:56.000]  not their language. Sometimes it's not
[13:56.000 --> 13:58.000]  even any possible language. Why is pronunciation
[13:58.000 --> 14:00.000]  and intonation so important to language?
[14:00.000 --> 14:02.000]  Why aren't words themselves
[14:02.000 --> 14:04.000]  sufficient to convey meaning?
[14:04.000 --> 14:06.000]  Well, you have to understand somebody else's words.
[14:06.000 --> 14:08.000]  I mean, if you go to central London and somebody
[14:08.000 --> 14:10.000]  is pronounced speaking Cockney and
[14:10.000 --> 14:12.000]  the words happen to
[14:12.000 --> 14:14.000]  match ours at some abstract level,
[14:14.000 --> 14:16.000]  you still may not understand them.
[14:16.000 --> 14:18.000]  The pronunciation may be different enough so that
[14:18.000 --> 14:20.000]  part of your knowledge of language
[14:20.000 --> 14:22.000]  is a way of decoding
[14:22.000 --> 14:24.000]  noises that you hear and converting
[14:24.000 --> 14:26.000]  them into a system that matches
[14:26.000 --> 14:28.000]  your own representations.
[14:28.000 --> 14:30.000]  Sometimes, no matter if that decoding system
[14:30.000 --> 14:32.000]  to work, the systems have to be
[14:32.000 --> 14:34.000]  close enough. You and I can do it.
[14:34.000 --> 14:36.000]  Actually, if you listen to us closely,
[14:36.000 --> 14:38.000]  we're speaking different languages.
[14:38.000 --> 14:40.000]  But they're close enough so that we don't have any
[14:40.000 --> 14:42.000]  problem decoding you and you don't have a problem
[14:42.000 --> 14:44.000]  decoding me. But again,
[14:44.000 --> 14:46.000]  that's a little artificial. That's because of the
[14:46.000 --> 14:48.000]  artificial unity of the
[14:48.000 --> 14:50.000]  English language spoken
[14:50.000 --> 14:52.000]  in the United States.
[14:52.000 --> 14:54.000]  I happened to be in England last week and I
[14:54.000 --> 14:56.000]  confined myself in places in England where I don't
[14:56.000 --> 14:58.000]  understand what they're saying.
[14:58.000 --> 15:00.000]  If I listen to them for a while,
[15:00.000 --> 15:02.000]  we can establish communication.
[15:02.000 --> 15:04.000]  But you have to kind of
[15:04.000 --> 15:06.000]  retune your system in some
[15:06.000 --> 15:08.000]  manner that's not understood so that you can begin
[15:08.000 --> 15:10.000]  to decode what you're hearing.
[15:10.000 --> 15:12.000]  What role does slang have in a language?
[15:12.000 --> 15:14.000]  Why does slang exist?
[15:14.000 --> 15:16.000]  Why, I don't know. But the fact is,
[15:16.000 --> 15:18.000]  people are very innovative and they like to do things
[15:18.000 --> 15:20.000]  differently, and especially teenage
[15:20.000 --> 15:22.000]  cultures. Why do teenagers wear different
[15:22.000 --> 15:24.000]  clothes? Well, you know, whatever
[15:24.000 --> 15:26.000]  the reason is, they want to be different, they like
[15:26.000 --> 15:28.000]  to be innovative, they're creative.
[15:28.000 --> 15:30.000]  So there's fads in fashions and language?
[15:30.000 --> 15:32.000]  Oh, sure. And in fact, there are
[15:32.000 --> 15:34.000]  styles of different groups.
[15:34.000 --> 15:36.000]  Some of them change very rapidly.
[15:36.000 --> 15:38.000]  The words that are in
[15:38.000 --> 15:40.000]  one era are
[15:40.000 --> 15:42.000]  archaic and in another, the era
[15:42.000 --> 15:44.000]  can be three years or something like that.
[15:44.000 --> 15:46.000]  And people are playing with their languages often.
[15:46.000 --> 15:48.000]  Again, this is not too common
[15:48.000 --> 15:50.000]  in our societies. Our societies,
[15:50.000 --> 15:52.000]  remember, are basically technological societies.
[15:52.000 --> 15:54.000]  Our intelligence
[15:54.000 --> 15:56.000]  and creativity
[15:56.000 --> 15:58.000]  and so on goes into other things.
[15:58.000 --> 16:00.000]  But if you go to, say, Central Australia,
[16:00.000 --> 16:02.000]  where you're finding
[16:02.000 --> 16:04.000]  basically Stone Age tribes,
[16:04.000 --> 16:06.000]  there's a lot of innovation in
[16:06.000 --> 16:08.000]  language. A lot of the cultural wealth
[16:08.000 --> 16:10.000]  has to do with playing games with languages
[16:10.000 --> 16:12.000]  and constructing elaborate kinship systems
[16:12.000 --> 16:14.000]  and things which probably have no
[16:14.000 --> 16:16.000]  or little functional utility.
[16:16.000 --> 16:18.000]  It's just the creative mind that work.
[16:18.000 --> 16:20.000]  So you get
[16:20.000 --> 16:22.000]  very complex language games,
[16:22.000 --> 16:24.000]  a special language system taught
[16:24.000 --> 16:26.000]  as a puberty rite and only a particular
[16:26.000 --> 16:28.000]  group of people speak it and nobody else understands it.
[16:28.000 --> 16:30.000]  How does language differ in the way that it's
[16:30.000 --> 16:32.000]  used in the arts? First of all,
[16:32.000 --> 16:34.000]  there's a variety of conventions,
[16:34.000 --> 16:36.000]  of formal
[16:36.000 --> 16:38.000]  conventions that are humanly
[16:38.000 --> 16:40.000]  created but undoubtedly reflect
[16:40.000 --> 16:42.000]  our aesthetic capacities
[16:42.000 --> 16:44.000]  that set a framework
[16:44.000 --> 16:46.000]  within which, they set a framework of
[16:46.000 --> 16:48.000]  rule, humanly imposed rule
[16:48.000 --> 16:50.000]  within which people create.
[16:50.000 --> 16:52.000]  So in an extreme case,
[16:52.000 --> 16:54.000]  if you write a sonnet, you have to come
[16:54.000 --> 16:56.000]  pretty close to a fixed frame.
[16:56.000 --> 16:58.000]  And while that's an
[16:58.000 --> 17:00.000]  extreme case, the same is true of other literary
[17:00.000 --> 17:02.000]  conventions. I mean, part of
[17:02.000 --> 17:04.000]  human creative intervention
[17:04.000 --> 17:06.000]  has been to create forms, aesthetic
[17:06.000 --> 17:08.000]  forms, which are somehow
[17:08.000 --> 17:10.000]  either appealing to us or
[17:10.000 --> 17:12.000]  challenge our intelligence
[17:12.000 --> 17:14.000]  or whatever. And
[17:14.000 --> 17:16.000]  you work within them.
[17:16.000 --> 17:18.000]  After all, painting
[17:18.000 --> 17:20.000]  on a piece of canvas
[17:20.000 --> 17:22.000]  that has a boundary,
[17:22.000 --> 17:24.000]  that's pretty recent in human history
[17:24.000 --> 17:26.000]  and that itself imposes
[17:26.000 --> 17:28.000]  a framework which determines the kind
[17:28.000 --> 17:30.000]  of art that you can produce.
[17:30.000 --> 17:32.000]  And the
[17:32.000 --> 17:34.000]  literary use of language is just
[17:34.000 --> 17:36.000]  everything from the structure
[17:36.000 --> 17:38.000]  of a novel to the
[17:38.000 --> 17:40.000]  metric
[17:40.000 --> 17:42.000]  character of a poetic
[17:42.000 --> 17:44.000]  form is one or another
[17:44.000 --> 17:46.000]  human invention.
[17:46.000 --> 17:48.000]  Do you respond to poetry?
[17:48.000 --> 17:50.000]  Do I? Sure. I have time to read it.
[17:50.000 --> 17:52.000]  Does it make you
[17:52.000 --> 17:54.000]  think differently? What goes on
[17:54.000 --> 17:56.000]  in your thought process?
[17:56.000 --> 17:58.000]  Well, you know,
[17:58.000 --> 18:00.000]  I don't feel competent to say,
[18:00.000 --> 18:02.000]  but it's a topic that has been discussed
[18:02.000 --> 18:04.000]  quite intelligently. So, for example,
[18:04.000 --> 18:06.000]  if you read, say, not by me,
[18:06.000 --> 18:08.000]  I have nothing to say about it, no one
[18:08.000 --> 18:10.000]  to pretend to. But if you read, say,
[18:10.000 --> 18:12.000]  William Empson's Seven Types of
[18:12.000 --> 18:14.000]  Ambiguity, you get an intriguing
[18:14.000 --> 18:16.000]  account of why poetry
[18:16.000 --> 18:18.000]  makes you think,
[18:18.000 --> 18:20.000]  in part because it's so compressed
[18:20.000 --> 18:22.000]  and you only get hints,
[18:22.000 --> 18:24.000]  so the reader has to impose
[18:24.000 --> 18:26.000]  a lot of structure. You have to put your own
[18:26.000 --> 18:28.000]  self into it. And in part because
[18:28.000 --> 18:30.000]  the formal structure itself
[18:30.000 --> 18:32.000]  imposes a challenge
[18:32.000 --> 18:34.000]  to the intelligence.
[18:34.000 --> 18:36.000]  If you're just throwing paints around
[18:36.000 --> 18:38.000]  randomly, it's not a work of art.
[18:38.000 --> 18:40.000]  But when it's done
[18:40.000 --> 18:42.000]  within the framework of a
[18:42.000 --> 18:44.000]  humanly constructed system of
[18:44.000 --> 18:46.000]  rule,
[18:46.000 --> 18:48.000]  at least you've got the prerequisites
[18:48.000 --> 18:50.000]  for a work of art, it still may not be.
[18:50.000 --> 18:52.000]  Whatever it takes,
[18:52.000 --> 18:54.000]  whatever creativity is, and that's not understood,
[18:54.000 --> 18:56.000]  that has to be there too.
[18:56.000 --> 18:58.000]  But I,
[18:58.000 --> 19:00.000]  certainly I have nothing to say about these topics,
[19:00.000 --> 19:02.000]  I wouldn't pretend to. We bring up another
[19:02.000 --> 19:04.000]  area you can claim you have no expertise in,
[19:04.000 --> 19:06.000]  and that's the use of humor.
[19:06.000 --> 19:08.000]  We respond to people who use
[19:08.000 --> 19:10.000]  humor in communication, yet it's
[19:10.000 --> 19:12.000]  not taught in grade school.
[19:12.000 --> 19:14.000]  We're not taught how to be comedians,
[19:14.000 --> 19:16.000]  but we respond to it, and that seems to be
[19:16.000 --> 19:18.000]  the case in almost every language.
[19:18.000 --> 19:20.000]  Well, see, I don't think that has
[19:20.000 --> 19:22.000]  too much to do with language. We can be humorous
[19:22.000 --> 19:24.000]  in other ways too. A clown
[19:24.000 --> 19:26.000]  can be humorous without using
[19:26.000 --> 19:28.000]  language, and nobody teaches a child
[19:28.000 --> 19:30.000]  how to laugh at a clown.
[19:30.000 --> 19:32.000]  Now, I think
[19:32.000 --> 19:34.000]  we're going here to interesting topics,
[19:34.000 --> 19:36.000]  but topics where nothing is understood.
[19:36.000 --> 19:38.000]  There's no doubt in my mind
[19:38.000 --> 19:40.000]  that there's something about human nature,
[19:40.000 --> 19:42.000]  the basic structure
[19:42.000 --> 19:44.000]  of the human
[19:44.000 --> 19:46.000]  mind-brain,
[19:46.000 --> 19:48.000]  which makes certain things
[19:48.000 --> 19:50.000]  comical, and other things not,
[19:50.000 --> 19:52.000]  just as there's certain things about the human
[19:52.000 --> 19:54.000]  brain that make some things come out to be
[19:54.000 --> 19:56.000]  human language and others not, although they could
[19:56.000 --> 19:58.000]  be a Martian language or something.
[19:58.000 --> 20:00.000]  And at its root,
[20:00.000 --> 20:02.000]  it's, I don't think, fundamentally different
[20:02.000 --> 20:04.000]  from the fact that we grow arms and not wings.
[20:04.000 --> 20:06.000]  Now, we don't know why we grow arms and not wings,
[20:06.000 --> 20:08.000]  but you assume that it's got something
[20:08.000 --> 20:10.000]  to do with the human genetic endowment,
[20:10.000 --> 20:12.000]  and I think the comparable
[20:12.000 --> 20:14.000]  assumption is true in all these cases.
[20:14.000 --> 20:16.000]  One of the, part of the fascination
[20:16.000 --> 20:18.000]  of the study of language is that
[20:18.000 --> 20:20.000]  it's one of the few examples
[20:20.000 --> 20:22.000]  where you can really get some insight
[20:22.000 --> 20:24.000]  into how it works.
[20:24.000 --> 20:26.000]  These other topics that you're mentioning, say humor,
[20:26.000 --> 20:28.000]  should be subjected
[20:28.000 --> 20:30.000]  to the same kind of study,
[20:30.000 --> 20:32.000]  but so far it hasn't been clear how to do it.
[20:34.000 --> 20:36.000]  Words are endlessly fascinating,
[20:36.000 --> 20:38.000]  I think, because it's amazing how
[20:38.000 --> 20:40.000]  somebody can walk in a room,
[20:40.000 --> 20:42.000]  hear a few words, and walk out crying,
[20:42.000 --> 20:44.000]  or angry,
[20:44.000 --> 20:46.000]  or this whole series of emotions
[20:46.000 --> 20:48.000]  simply with a few words.
[20:48.000 --> 20:50.000]  Doesn't that constantly amaze you?
[20:50.000 --> 20:52.000]  It's not just words, again.
[20:52.000 --> 20:54.000]  It could be a fleeting picture.
[20:54.000 --> 20:56.000]  Take, say, a caricature.
[20:56.000 --> 20:58.000]  You see a few lines, you know,
[20:58.000 --> 21:00.000]  and it brings to your mind
[21:00.000 --> 21:02.000]  a person in a situation,
[21:02.000 --> 21:04.000]  maybe a tragic situation,
[21:04.000 --> 21:06.000]  or a comical situation, or whatever.
[21:06.000 --> 21:08.000]  I mean, the human mind is a
[21:08.000 --> 21:10.000]  very marvelous thing.
[21:10.000 --> 21:12.000]  It's got an extremely
[21:12.000 --> 21:14.000]  intricate and complex structure,
[21:14.000 --> 21:16.000]  which, at least at a scientific level,
[21:16.000 --> 21:18.000]  we understand very little about.
[21:18.000 --> 21:20.000]  But what you're pointing to
[21:20.000 --> 21:22.000]  is a central part of it.
[21:22.000 --> 21:24.000]  Little hints here and there
[21:24.000 --> 21:26.000]  succeed in evoking in us
[21:26.000 --> 21:28.000]  a very rich experience
[21:28.000 --> 21:30.000]  and interpretation.
[21:30.000 --> 21:32.000]  And what's more, it's done surprisingly
[21:32.000 --> 21:34.000]  uniformly for different people.
[21:34.000 --> 21:36.000]  And it's, of course, done without any
[21:36.000 --> 21:38.000]  training, or very minimal training,
[21:38.000 --> 21:40.000]  that we would know how to train people to do this.
[21:40.000 --> 21:42.000]  So it somehow must be
[21:42.000 --> 21:44.000]  the only logical possibility
[21:44.000 --> 21:46.000]  aside from angels
[21:46.000 --> 21:48.000]  or acts of God, is it something
[21:48.000 --> 21:50.000]  rooted in our nature?
[21:50.000 --> 21:52.000]  I mean, qualitatively speaking, these phenomena
[21:52.000 --> 21:54.000]  are very much like physical growth.
[21:54.000 --> 21:56.000]  The nutrition that's given to
[21:56.000 --> 21:58.000]  an organism, to an embryo,
[21:58.000 --> 22:00.000]  is not what determines
[22:00.000 --> 22:02.000]  that it's going to be a human or a bird.
[22:02.000 --> 22:04.000]  What determines that it's going to be
[22:04.000 --> 22:06.000]  a human or a bird is something about
[22:06.000 --> 22:08.000]  its internal structure.
[22:08.000 --> 22:10.000]  And what determines that we are going to be
[22:10.000 --> 22:12.000]  the kind of creature that can speak
[22:12.000 --> 22:18.000]  and interpret a sign
[22:18.000 --> 22:20.000]  or a couple of lines
[22:20.000 --> 22:22.000]  or something as evoking
[22:22.000 --> 22:24.000]  an emotional experience or whatever.
[22:24.000 --> 22:26.000]  That's something in our nature,
[22:26.000 --> 22:28.000]  but it's so far beyond what we know how to study
[22:28.000 --> 22:30.000]  that you can only
[22:30.000 --> 22:32.000]  wave your hands at it at the moment.
[22:32.000 --> 22:34.000]  How should parents react with respect
[22:34.000 --> 22:36.000]  to exposing their children to language?
[22:36.000 --> 22:38.000]  Should they expose them to all aspects
[22:38.000 --> 22:40.000]  of language, or should they simply let them
[22:40.000 --> 22:42.000]  develop any way they develop?
[22:42.000 --> 22:44.000]  I suspect there's very little that
[22:44.000 --> 22:46.000]  parents can do to change the course of
[22:46.000 --> 22:48.000]  language development.
[22:48.000 --> 22:50.000]  I mean, you can, we know from experience.
[22:50.000 --> 22:52.000]  Again, let me say I am not
[22:52.000 --> 22:54.000]  speaking about this from any expertise.
[22:54.000 --> 22:56.000]  I don't have any more expertise than
[22:56.000 --> 22:58.000]  personal experience. There's nothing in
[22:58.000 --> 23:00.000]  linguistic theory that gives answers to this question.
[23:00.000 --> 23:02.000]  But experience suffices to indicate
[23:02.000 --> 23:04.000]  that in no cases
[23:04.000 --> 23:06.000]  that you can
[23:06.000 --> 23:08.000]  create an environment in which a
[23:08.000 --> 23:10.000]  five-year-old will sound like a college professor
[23:10.000 --> 23:12.000]  and it's kind of comical, but they'll use big words
[23:12.000 --> 23:14.000]  and, you know, complicated sentences
[23:14.000 --> 23:16.000]  and so on. I suspect you're probably harming the
[23:16.000 --> 23:18.000]  five-year-old, but it's possible to do that.
[23:18.000 --> 23:20.000]  Children can be molded.
[23:20.000 --> 23:22.000]  On the other hand, if you just leave them alone,
[23:22.000 --> 23:24.000]  they're going to pick up the language
[23:24.000 --> 23:26.000]  of their culture.
[23:26.000 --> 23:28.000]  Typically they'll pick up the language of their
[23:28.000 --> 23:30.000]  peers. Quite typically,
[23:30.000 --> 23:32.000]  there are exceptions, but typically
[23:32.000 --> 23:34.000]  children will learn the language they
[23:34.000 --> 23:36.000]  heard in the streets. So take me.
[23:36.000 --> 23:38.000]  My father spoke with a Ukrainian
[23:38.000 --> 23:40.000]  accent and my mother spoke
[23:40.000 --> 23:42.000]  with a mixed New York-Lithuanian
[23:42.000 --> 23:44.000]  accent, and I spoke urban
[23:44.000 --> 23:46.000]  Philadelphia, because that's what the kids were talking in the
[23:46.000 --> 23:48.000]  streets. And
[23:48.000 --> 23:50.000]  undoubtedly, if you really took my
[23:50.000 --> 23:52.000]  speech patterns and so on aside,
[23:52.000 --> 23:54.000]  you'd find influences from
[23:54.000 --> 23:56.000]  the parents and the uncles and so on.
[23:56.000 --> 23:58.000]  But overwhelmingly, you pick
[23:58.000 --> 24:00.000]  up the pure culture. Why this happens, nobody
[24:00.000 --> 24:02.000]  knows. But there's
[24:02.000 --> 24:04.000]  something about humans,
[24:04.000 --> 24:06.000]  children, that gets them
[24:06.000 --> 24:08.000]  to grow the language that's
[24:08.000 --> 24:10.000]  roughly that of their peers.
[24:10.000 --> 24:12.000]  And it's a very
[24:12.000 --> 24:14.000]  rich system. It's an extremely rich
[24:14.000 --> 24:16.000]  system. They don't try. They can't
[24:16.000 --> 24:18.000]  prevent themselves from doing it.
[24:18.000 --> 24:20.000]  They can't make it happen.
[24:20.000 --> 24:22.000]  The parents can enrich the...
[24:22.000 --> 24:24.000]  Anyone who has a two-year-old
[24:24.000 --> 24:26.000]  knows that the kid is running
[24:26.000 --> 24:28.000]  around all over the place trying to find out what the name
[24:28.000 --> 24:30.000]  of everything is.
[24:30.000 --> 24:32.000]  What's that? What's that? What's that? And you can
[24:32.000 --> 24:34.000]  help them and you can
[24:34.000 --> 24:36.000]  read the children and show them pictures
[24:36.000 --> 24:38.000]  and they're all fascinated with it.
[24:38.000 --> 24:40.000]  They're periods of very rapid
[24:40.000 --> 24:42.000]  language growth where you just can't
[24:42.000 --> 24:44.000]  satiate the curiosity fast enough.
[24:44.000 --> 24:46.000]  Amazingly so. It's unbelievable
[24:46.000 --> 24:48.000]  in fact. What actually happens is
[24:48.000 --> 24:50.000]  really astonishing. I mean, there have been
[24:50.000 --> 24:52.000]  for example, at the peak periods of
[24:52.000 --> 24:54.000]  forget the structure of language, which is
[24:54.000 --> 24:56.000]  complicated enough, but just take vocabulary
[24:56.000 --> 24:58.000]  acquisition, the simplest part.
[24:58.000 --> 25:00.000]  At peak periods of
[25:00.000 --> 25:02.000]  acquisition of vocabulary, learning new
[25:02.000 --> 25:04.000]  words, children are picking
[25:04.000 --> 25:06.000]  them up at maybe a rate of one an hour
[25:06.000 --> 25:08.000]  or something, which means that they're
[25:08.000 --> 25:10.000]  essentially learning a word on one exposure.
[25:10.000 --> 25:12.000]  And the adults go into adult education
[25:12.000 --> 25:14.000]  and die trying to learn a new language.
[25:14.000 --> 25:16.000]  Oh, yeah. But you know, if you think
[25:16.000 --> 25:18.000]  what it means to learn a word on one
[25:18.000 --> 25:20.000]  exposure, the way to understand
[25:20.000 --> 25:22.000]  how amazing an achievement this
[25:22.000 --> 25:24.000]  is, is to try to define a word.
[25:24.000 --> 25:26.000]  Suppose you had an organism
[25:26.000 --> 25:28.000]  that wasn't equipped to learn
[25:28.000 --> 25:30.000]  the words of human language, and you
[25:30.000 --> 25:32.000]  really had to teach it those words
[25:32.000 --> 25:34.000]  by training. Well, you'd first have
[25:34.000 --> 25:36.000]  to define a word. What is the meaning
[25:36.000 --> 25:38.000]  of table, for instance? Nobody can do that.
[25:38.000 --> 25:40.000]  You have to define the definition you're
[25:40.000 --> 25:42.000]  using to define the word. But you see,
[25:42.000 --> 25:44.000]  what we call definitions are not
[25:44.000 --> 25:46.000]  definitions. They're just hints.
[25:46.000 --> 25:48.000]  If you take the Oxford English Dictionary,
[25:48.000 --> 25:50.000]  you know, the one you read with a magnifying glass,
[25:50.000 --> 25:52.000]  and they give you a long,
[25:52.000 --> 25:54.000]  detailed thing, which they call the definition of a
[25:54.000 --> 25:56.000]  word. In fact, it's very far from the definition of
[25:56.000 --> 25:58.000]  a word. It's a few hints that a person
[25:58.000 --> 26:00.000]  who already knows the concept
[26:00.000 --> 26:02.000]  can use to understand what's going on.
[26:02.000 --> 26:04.000]  But remember, the child is picking
[26:04.000 --> 26:06.000]  that up not from the Oxford English Dictionary
[26:06.000 --> 26:08.000]  with its whole array of hints. The child's
[26:08.000 --> 26:10.000]  picking it up from seeing it used
[26:10.000 --> 26:12.000]  once or twice. Now, that can
[26:12.000 --> 26:14.000]  only mean one thing. It can only
[26:14.000 --> 26:16.000]  mean that the concept itself,
[26:16.000 --> 26:18.000]  in all of its richness and complexity,
[26:18.000 --> 26:20.000]  is somehow sitting there,
[26:20.000 --> 26:22.000]  waiting to have a sound associated with it.
[26:22.000 --> 26:24.000]  Now, that can't be quite true,
[26:24.000 --> 26:26.000]  but something very much like that
[26:26.000 --> 26:28.000]  is probably true. That's why
[26:28.000 --> 26:30.000]  you and I will have essentially
[26:30.000 --> 26:32.000]  the same concept of table
[26:32.000 --> 26:34.000]  and the same concept of person
[26:34.000 --> 26:36.000]  and of, you know,
[26:36.000 --> 26:38.000]  nation or all sorts of
[26:38.000 --> 26:40.000]  things, and not complicated
[26:40.000 --> 26:42.000]  things. I mean really simple things like
[26:42.000 --> 26:44.000]  person, for instance, or thing.
[26:44.000 --> 26:46.000]  We'll have that even though we all have
[26:46.000 --> 26:48.000]  very limited experience because basically
[26:48.000 --> 26:50.000]  we started with those concepts.
[26:50.000 --> 26:52.000]  We're getting down to the end of the show.
[26:52.000 --> 26:54.000]  Have you ever seen a time when the study of
[26:54.000 --> 26:56.000]  language and linguistics will not
[26:56.000 --> 26:58.000]  fascinate you? Well, I suppose
[26:58.000 --> 27:00.000]  there must come some time when your mind
[27:00.000 --> 27:02.000]  deteriorates to the point where you can't
[27:02.000 --> 27:04.000]  deal with hard questions. I guess that'll happen.
