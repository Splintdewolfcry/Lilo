     - Worked on getting bits from Marginnote to Obsidian working
     - Imported grouped quotes in Marginnote one by one into Evernote
     - Because Evernote does some weird ass formating, I found some apps that parses Evernote's .enex format into md 
	     - Now that's it's working properly, I've imported that into Obsidian with a HUGE HELP from Bing AI
	 - Tomorrow it should be relatively easier

- When you work on it tomorrow:
	- Make parser.py parse the actual md file and test it out on at least 3 differently styled md files
	- Make an aws backup
	- Maybe run evernote backups daily or something like that
		- Bottom line: integrate it with another bucket in S3
	- Make this whole process a bit more automatic
	- Use pathlib to look for every md file in a given directory and make sure the script tries each one of them out
