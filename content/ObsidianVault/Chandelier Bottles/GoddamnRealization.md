When my mom says something along the lines that I *always* do smth(in terms that it's wrong and I keep doing it or acting the *same* way), I think I am very much disturbed by the fact that it's stripping me of the energy I spend on healing myself, the thoughts i had in the meantime(could be a week, month or longer, not the point) and we had this problem in a much bigger scale a few years back(during first few years of the high school) so I am still sore from that but also I really do not like my efforts disregarded, I think it's rude, offensive and quite frankly disturbing. I am not sure why I think i hate being static but it has much more modularity than i care to delve into right now so maybe smth to think about?
