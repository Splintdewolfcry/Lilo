I feel broken, emptied by a hollow set of people. It's a type of broken with 'able to function salad' on the side. The days I wake up, I wake up. Not with too much pain, loneliness or afraid, I just do. I fulfill what I'm supposed to for that day, without much thought, without much need to deny it. And then some days come and I see how many pieces I tried to piece back together that dau, sometimes sadly with a cheap glue. I think to myself sometimes, I think how much I tried to keep them together, keep these people a part of ny life, ny dreams, my thoughts and it feels weird. I understand the notion of letting someone go, or rather the need to let someone go. But these, people that left were more than anything I've ever had, known or tasted. These people leave though, not by much force, most interestingly, they just up and leave, like we haven't laughed, danced, watched the sun go down together. Actions matter, somebody who is getting close to you won't change how they behave towards you after you get close and things are going bad now. No' they ll not leave their comfort zone, because there is no need. En az Ã§aba ilkesi. When people are falling out of love, they fall out of love with the things they fell in love about you in the first place. 
We want someone to keep track of our stories, some kind of wobbly path we bind ourselves to. Not with many alternatives, we walk on these pieces of tiles that has spaces between them. They fail to move forward
