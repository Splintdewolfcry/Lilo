    - You worked on Programming for 0 days 00:49:15 (with tags #WorkedOnMildew, #PrepFor_Obsidian, #InspiredWork)
	- Got my Quartz website up and running through another, more school focused vault
	- However I wanted something that would host both vaults and a lil more automatic as to show whatever I need
	- Faster deployment and more importantly it being robust
	- Now got it nicely working, needs folder exclusion but still currently works for every bit of whatever I need
