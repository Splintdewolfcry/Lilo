### Log
- [[WatsonFrames/ids/47eeca9]]
     - You worked on Programming for 0 days 01:22:00 (with tags #InspiredWork)
	 - Worked on removing duplicates but it needs a little bit more work because it's very barebones right now
	 - Currently calls mbto twice so that's not very good
	 - Does not work if the day changes when it's been called because the daily notes section works based on the stop time, meaning sometimes the start time and end time has a day difference, this results in notes being different and therefore it's not understood as a duplicate so not removed
