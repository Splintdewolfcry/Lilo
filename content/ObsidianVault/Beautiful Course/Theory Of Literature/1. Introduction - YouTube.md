[00:00.000 --> 00:01.960]  All right.
[00:01.960 --> 00:04.000]  Now I thought I'd begin today.
[00:04.000 --> 00:07.600]  This is, by the way, a regular practice.
[00:07.600 --> 00:11.400]  This is as close as I get to bulleted PowerPoint.
[00:11.400 --> 00:13.000]  It's all there.
[00:13.000 --> 00:17.000]  I ought to have got through those topics by the end of the
[00:17.000 --> 00:17.760]  lecture.
[00:17.760 --> 00:21.920]  If I don't, not to worry, I'll pick up wherever the dotted
[00:21.920 --> 00:25.000]  line emerges in the subsequent lecture.
[00:25.000 --> 00:28.160]  But in any case, I thought I'd begin today by
[00:28.160 --> 00:32.880]  making a few remarks about the title of our course because it
[00:32.880 --> 00:37.160]  has some big words in it, theory and literature,
[00:37.160 --> 00:38.920]  but also introduction.
[00:38.920 --> 00:42.040]  I think it's worth saying a word or two about the word
[00:42.040 --> 00:43.480]  introduction as well.
[00:43.480 --> 00:47.320]  Now theory has a very complicated etymological
[00:47.320 --> 00:50.280]  history that I won't trouble you with.
[00:50.280 --> 00:53.560]  The trouble with the etymology of theory and the way in which
[00:53.560 --> 00:56.480]  the word has been used traditionally is that sometimes
[00:56.480 --> 01:00.760]  it actually means practice, and then at other historical
[01:00.760 --> 01:04.720]  periods it means something very different from practice,
[01:04.720 --> 01:08.720]  something typically from which practice is derived.
[01:08.720 --> 01:13.160]  Well, that's the sense of theory that I like to work with,
[01:13.160 --> 01:17.200]  and I would pause over it by saying that after all there is a
[01:17.200 --> 01:19.880]  difference, and we shouldn't too quickly at
[01:19.880 --> 01:21.360]  least confuse the terms.
[01:21.360 --> 01:24.640]  There's a difference between theory and methodology.
[01:24.640 --> 01:29.720]  Yes, it's probably fair enough to say that methodology is
[01:29.720 --> 01:33.440]  applied theory, but there's a great danger in
[01:33.440 --> 01:37.800]  supposing that every aspect of theory has an immediate
[01:37.800 --> 01:39.000]  application.
[01:39.000 --> 01:44.040]  Theory is very often a purely speculative undertaking.
[01:44.040 --> 01:47.040]  It's a hypothesis about something,
[01:47.040 --> 01:51.160]  the exact nature of which one needn't necessarily have in
[01:51.160 --> 01:51.800]  view.
[01:51.800 --> 01:55.640]  It's a supposition that whatever the object of theory
[01:55.640 --> 01:56.920]  might be, it must,
[01:56.920 --> 02:01.080]  owing to whatever intellectual constraints one can imagine,
[02:01.080 --> 02:02.880]  be of such a form.
[02:02.880 --> 02:06.040]  At this level of abstraction, plainly,
[02:06.040 --> 02:11.200]  there isn't all that much incentive to apply thinking of
[02:11.200 --> 02:12.400]  that kind.
[02:12.400 --> 02:15.040]  But on the other hand, undoubtedly,
[02:15.040 --> 02:19.080]  theory does exist for the most part to be applied.
[02:19.080 --> 02:23.840]  Very frequently courses of this kind have a text,
[02:23.840 --> 02:27.960]  Lycidas, The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,
[02:27.960 --> 02:31.320]  a short story, and then once in a while the
[02:31.320 --> 02:34.920]  disquisition of the lecturer will pause,
[02:34.920 --> 02:38.480]  the text will be produced, and whatever theory has recently
[02:38.480 --> 02:42.360]  been talked about will be applied to the text so that you'll get a
[02:42.360 --> 02:45.760]  post-colonial reading of The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,
[02:45.760 --> 02:48.360]  something, by the way, which is absolutely fascinating
[02:48.360 --> 02:52.640]  and important to do, and so on through the course.
[02:52.640 --> 02:56.560]  Now I suppose it's my reluctance to get into the
[02:56.560 --> 03:01.480]  intricacies of questions having to do with applied theory that
[03:01.480 --> 03:04.640]  makes me prefer to keep it simple.
[03:04.640 --> 03:12.240]  Our text is a story for toddlers called Tony the Tow Truck.
[03:12.240 --> 03:15.920]  I've decided not to pass it out today because after all I want
[03:15.920 --> 03:17.880]  to get it into the right hands.
[03:17.880 --> 03:20.040]  I can't read it unless you take the course.
[03:20.040 --> 03:23.480]  So I'm going to wait a little bit.
[03:23.480 --> 03:27.160]  We don't come back to it, at least for the moment,
[03:27.160 --> 03:31.800]  but you see that it's mercifully short and as time
[03:31.800 --> 03:36.440]  passes we will do some rather interesting tricks with it.
[03:36.440 --> 03:39.120]  We will revert, as others revert to
[03:39.120 --> 03:43.160]  Lycidas to Tony the Tow Truck for the purpose of introducing
[03:43.160 --> 03:45.440]  questions of applied theory.
[03:45.440 --> 03:49.600]  Now this may suggest a certain condescension both towards
[03:49.600 --> 03:52.040]  theory and towards literary texts,
[03:52.040 --> 03:54.640]  which is not at all intended.
[03:54.640 --> 03:58.880]  It's much more a question of reminding you that if you can do
[03:58.880 --> 04:01.600]  it with this you can do it with anything,
[04:01.600 --> 04:06.520]  but also of reminding you that after all reading,
[04:06.520 --> 04:11.440]  reading just anything, is a complex and potentially
[04:11.440 --> 04:14.400]  almost unlimited activity.
[04:14.400 --> 04:19.120]  That's one of the good things that theory teaches us and that I
[04:19.120 --> 04:23.880]  hope to be able to get across in the course of our varied
[04:23.880 --> 04:26.760]  approaches to Tony the Tow Truck.
[04:26.760 --> 04:33.920]  Now theory resembles philosophy perhaps in this,
[04:33.920 --> 04:38.280]  that it asks fundamental questions and also at times
[04:38.280 --> 04:39.880]  builds systems.
[04:39.880 --> 04:43.400]  That is to say, theory has certain ambitions
[04:43.400 --> 04:47.960]  for a totalization of what can be thought that resembles or
[04:47.960 --> 04:49.640]  rivals philosophy.
[04:49.640 --> 04:52.000]  But theory differs from philosophy,
[04:52.000 --> 04:55.640]  and this is something that I'm going to be coming back to
[04:55.640 --> 05:00.000]  persistingly in the second half of this lecture and many times
[05:00.000 --> 05:01.000]  hereafter.
[05:01.000 --> 05:05.280]  Theory differs from most philosophy in that it involves
[05:05.280 --> 05:09.000]  a certain, and this is by no means self-evident,
[05:09.000 --> 05:11.560]  why should this be, is one of the questions we're
[05:11.560 --> 05:12.520]  going to be asking.
[05:12.520 --> 05:14.840]  It involves a certain skepticism.
[05:14.840 --> 05:18.920]  There seems to be a doubt, a variety of doubts,
[05:18.920 --> 05:22.520]  about the foundations of what we can think,
[05:22.520 --> 05:27.000]  about the basis of our opinions that pervades theory,
[05:27.000 --> 05:30.720]  seems somehow or another to characterize its history.
[05:30.720 --> 05:35.120]  Not all theory that we read in this course is skeptical.
[05:35.120 --> 05:38.960]  Some of the most powerful and profound thought that's been
[05:39.040 --> 05:43.240]  attributed to the subject of theory of literature is positive
[05:43.240 --> 05:45.960]  in its intentions and in its views,
[05:45.960 --> 05:50.360]  but by and large you will happily or unhappily come to
[05:50.360 --> 05:55.680]  terms with the fact that much of what you're going to be reading
[05:55.680 --> 05:58.840]  this semester is undergirded or perhaps,
[05:58.840 --> 06:02.720]  I should say, undermined by this persisting
[06:02.720 --> 06:03.960]  skepticism.
[06:03.960 --> 06:06.720]  It's crucial, as I say, and I'm going to be
[06:06.800 --> 06:09.720]  coming back to it, but it's just a point I want
[06:09.720 --> 06:12.960]  to make in passing about the nature of theory now.
[06:12.960 --> 06:17.160]  Turning to the word literature, this is not theory of
[06:17.160 --> 06:19.360]  relativity, theory of music,
[06:19.360 --> 06:20.680]  theory of government.
[06:20.680 --> 06:22.880]  This is a course in theory of literature,
[06:22.880 --> 06:26.800]  and theory of literature shares in common with other kinds of
[06:26.800 --> 06:28.960]  theory the need for definition.
[06:28.960 --> 06:33.200]  That is to say, it may be the most central and
[06:34.160 --> 06:38.240]  for me possibly the most fascinating question theory
[06:38.240 --> 06:40.960]  asks is, well, what is literature?
[06:40.960 --> 06:42.040]  How do we know it?
[06:42.040 --> 06:45.160]  When we see it, how can we define it?
[06:45.160 --> 06:48.400]  Now much of what we'll be reading takes up the question,
[06:48.400 --> 06:52.120]  what is literature, and provides us with fascinating
[06:52.120 --> 06:56.400]  and always for the moment, I think, enticing definitions.
[06:56.400 --> 07:00.200]  There are definitions based on form, circularity,
[07:00.240 --> 07:04.360]  symmetry, economy of form, lack of economy of form,
[07:04.360 --> 07:05.400]  repetition.
[07:05.400 --> 07:09.480]  There are definitions based on psychological complexity,
[07:09.480 --> 07:12.760]  psychological balance, psychological harmony,
[07:12.760 --> 07:16.200]  sometimes psychological imbalance and disharmony,
[07:16.200 --> 07:20.200]  and there are also definitions which insist that somehow
[07:20.200 --> 07:24.200]  there is an epistemological difference between literature
[07:24.200 --> 07:28.640]  and other kinds of utterance, whereas most utterances purport
[07:28.720 --> 07:32.920]  to be saying something true about the actual state of things
- [07:32.920 --> 07:36.040]  in the world, <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">literary utterance is under
[07:36.040 --> 07:39.040]  no such obligation, the argument goes,
[07:39.040 --> 07:42.400]  and ought properly to be understood as fiction,
[07:42.400 --> 07:46.240]  making it up as opposed to referring.</mark>

[07:46.240 --> 07:47.040]  All right.
[07:47.040 --> 07:49.640]  Now all of these definitions have had currency.
[07:49.640 --> 07:54.640]  We'll be going over them again and finding them,
[07:54.640 --> 07:58.440]  I hope, more fascinating as we learn more about them.
[07:58.440 --> 08:02.040]  But at the same time, even as I rattle off this list
[08:02.040 --> 08:05.440]  of possibilities, probably you felt yourself an
[08:05.440 --> 08:07.440]  upsurge of skepticism.
[08:07.440 --> 08:10.440]  You said, My goodness, I can easily find exceptions to
[08:10.440 --> 08:11.440]  all those rules.
[08:11.440 --> 08:14.840]  It's ridiculous to think that literature could be defined in
[08:14.840 --> 08:19.040]  any one of those ways or even in a combination of all of them.
[08:19.040 --> 08:22.440]  Literature is many things, a many splendid thing,
[08:22.440 --> 08:25.440]  you say to yourself, and it simply cannot be
[08:25.440 --> 08:29.440]  confined or trapped within a definition of that kind.
[08:29.440 --> 08:32.440]  Well and good, properly ecumenical of you,
[08:32.440 --> 08:37.440]  but at the same time it gives rise to a sense that possibly,
[08:37.440 --> 08:42.440]  after all, literature just isn't anything at all.
[08:42.440 --> 08:45.440]  In other words, that literature may not be
[08:45.440 --> 08:49.440]  susceptible of definition, of any one definition,
[08:49.440 --> 08:52.440]  but it is rather, and this is the so-called
[08:52.440 --> 08:56.440]  neopragmatist[^1] argument, but it is rather whatever you
[08:56.440 --> 08:59.440]  think it is or, more precisely,
[08:59.440 --> 09:04.440]  whatever your interpretive community says that it is.
[09:04.440 --> 09:06.440]  This is really a big problem.
[09:06.440 --> 09:09.440]  It's kind of unsettling because we like to know what things are,
[09:09.440 --> 09:13.440]  but at the same time it's not really a big problem because as
[09:13.440 --> 09:17.440]  long as we know about the fact that a certain notion of
[09:17.440 --> 09:20.440]  literature exists in certain communities,
[09:20.440 --> 09:24.440]  we can begin to do very interesting work precisely with
[09:24.440 --> 09:25.440]  that idea.
[09:25.440 --> 09:30.440]  We can say there's a great deal to learn about what people think
[09:30.440 --> 09:33.440]  literature is, and we can develop very
[09:33.440 --> 09:38.440]  interesting kinds of thinking about the variety of ways in
[09:38.440 --> 09:42.440]  which these ideas are expressed.
[09:42.440 --> 09:46.440]  So it's not perhaps crippling if this is the conclusion we
[09:46.440 --> 09:50.440]  reach, but at the same time it's not the only possible
[09:50.440 --> 09:51.440]  conclusion.
[09:51.440 --> 09:54.440]  The possibility of definition persists.
[09:54.440 --> 09:58.440]  Definition is important to us, and we're certainly not going to
[09:58.440 --> 10:01.440]  give it short shrift in this course.
[10:01.440 --> 10:05.440]  We're going to make every effort to define literature as
[10:05.440 --> 10:07.440]  carefully as we can.
[10:07.440 --> 10:10.440]  Now in addition to defining literature,
- [10:10.440 --> 10:14.440]  <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">literary theory also asks questions obviously not unrelated
- [10:14.440 --> 10:17.440]  but which open up the field somewhat.
- [10:17.440 --> 10:23.440]  What causes literature and what are the effects of literature?</mark>
[10:23.440 --> 10:27.440]  In a way, there's a subset of questions that arises from those
[10:27.440 --> 10:30.440]  to the effect, and this is of course what we'll
[10:30.440 --> 10:32.440]  be taking up next time, the question,
[10:32.440 --> 10:33.440]  what is an author?
[10:33.440 --> 10:36.440]  That is to say, if something causes literature,
[10:36.440 --> 10:39.440]  there must be some sort of authority behind it,
[10:39.440 --> 10:42.440]  and therefore we find ourselves asking,
[10:42.440 --> 10:44.440]  What is an author?
[10:44.440 --> 10:47.440]  By the same token, if literature has effects,
[10:47.440 --> 10:51.440]  it must have effects on someone, and this gives rise to the
[10:51.440 --> 10:54.440]  equally interesting and vexing question,
[10:54.440 --> 10:55.440]  What is a reader?
[10:55.440 --> 10:59.440]  Literary theory is very much involved with questions of that
[10:59.440 --> 11:02.440]  kind, and organizing those questions is
[11:02.440 --> 11:07.440]  basically what rationalizes the structure of our syllabus.
[11:07.440 --> 11:11.440]  You'll notice that we move in the syllabus after a couple of
[11:11.440 --> 11:15.440]  introductory talks that I'll mention in a minute.
[11:15.440 --> 11:20.440]  We move in the syllabus from the idea that literature is in some
[11:20.440 --> 11:25.440]  sense caused by language, to the idea that literature is in
[11:25.440 --> 11:29.440]  some sense caused by the human psyche,
[11:29.440 --> 11:34.440]  to the idea that literature is in some sense caused by social,
[11:34.440 --> 11:37.440]  economic, and historical forces.
[11:37.440 --> 11:42.440]  There are corollaries for those ideas in terms of the kinds of
[11:42.440 --> 11:47.440]  effects that literature has and what we might imagine ourselves
[11:47.440 --> 11:49.440]  to conclude from them.
- [11:49.440 --> 11:54.440]  <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Finally, literary theory asks one other important question.
</mark>
[11:54.440 --> 11:56.440]  It asks many, but this is the way at least
[11:56.440 --> 11:58.440]  I'm organizing it for today.
- [11:58.440 --> 12:00.440]  <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">It asks one other important question,
[12:00.440 --> 12:03.440]  the one with which we will actually begin.
[12:03.440 --> 12:08.440]  Not so much what is a reader, but how does reading get done?
[12:08.440 --> 12:11.440]  That is to say, how do we form the conclusion
[12:11.440 --> 12:14.440]  that we are interpreting something adequately,
[12:14.440 --> 12:18.440]  that we have a basis for the kind of reading that we're doing?</mark>
[12:18.440 --> 12:21.440]  <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">What is the reading experience like?
[12:21.440 --> 12:26.440]  How do we meet the text face to face?
[12:26.440 --> 12:30.440]  How do we put ourselves in touch with the text,
[12:30.440 --> 12:35.440]  which may after all in a variety of ways be remote from us?
[12:35.440 --> 12:39.440]  Now these are the questions that are asked by what's called
[12:39.440 --> 12:42.440]  hermeneutics, a difficult word that we will
[12:42.440 --> 12:44.440]  be taking up next week</mark>.
- [12:44.440 --> 12:48.440]  It has to do with <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">the god Hermes who conveyed language to
[12:48.440 --> 12:51.440]  man in a certain sense, among many other functions,
[12:51.440 --> 12:55.440]  the god of communication</mark>, and it is after all obviously
[12:55.440 --> 12:57.440]  about communication.
[12:57.440 --> 13:02.440]  So hermeneutics will be our first topic and it intends to
[13:02.440 --> 13:06.440]  answer the last question that I'll mention,
[13:06.440 --> 13:09.440]  which is raised by theory of literature.
[13:09.440 --> 13:10.440]  All right.
[13:10.440 --> 13:14.440]  Now let me pause quickly over the word introduction.
[13:14.440 --> 13:18.440]  I first started teaching this course in the late seventies and
[13:18.440 --> 13:22.440]  eighties when literary theory was a thing absolutely of the
[13:22.440 --> 13:23.440]  moment.
[13:23.440 --> 13:28.440]  As I told the teaching fellows, I had a colleague in those days
[13:28.440 --> 13:33.440]  who looked at me enviously and said he wished he had the black
[13:33.440 --> 13:35.440]  leather concession at the door.
[13:35.440 --> 13:40.440]  Theory was both hot and cool, and it was something about which
[13:40.440 --> 13:45.440]  following from that one had not just opinions but very,
[13:45.440 --> 13:48.440]  very strong opinions.
[13:48.440 --> 13:50.440]  In other words, the teaching fellows I had in
[13:50.440 --> 13:53.440]  those days who knows they may rise up against me in the same
[13:53.440 --> 13:56.440]  way this semester, but the teaching fellows I had
[13:56.440 --> 13:58.440]  in those days said, you can't teach an
[13:58.440 --> 13:59.440]  introduction.
[13:59.440 --> 14:02.440]  You can't teach a survey.
[14:02.440 --> 14:04.440]  You can't say, if it's Tuesday it must be
[14:04.440 --> 14:06.440]  Foucault, if it's Thursday it must be
[14:06.440 --> 14:07.440]  Lacan.
[14:07.440 --> 14:09.440]  You can't approach theory that way.
[14:09.440 --> 14:12.440]  Theory is important, and it's important to know what
[14:12.440 --> 14:13.440]  you believe.
[14:13.440 --> 14:15.440]  In other words, what the basis of all other
[14:15.440 --> 14:16.440]  possible theory is.
[14:16.440 --> 14:18.440]  I'm a feminist.
[14:18.440 --> 14:20.440]  I'm a Lacanian.
[14:20.440 --> 14:22.440]  I'm a student of Paul de Man.
[14:22.440 --> 14:26.440]  I believe that these are the foundational moments of
[14:26.440 --> 14:30.440]  theorizing and that if you're going to teach anything like a
[14:30.440 --> 14:34.440]  survey you've got to derive the rest of it from whatever the
[14:34.440 --> 14:37.440]  moment I happen to subscribe to might be.
[14:37.440 --> 14:41.440]  That's the way it felt to teach theory in those days.
[14:41.440 --> 14:43.440]  It was awkward teaching an introduction,
[14:43.440 --> 14:45.440]  and probably for that reason.
[14:45.440 --> 14:49.440]  While I was teaching Lit 300, which was called Lit Y,
[14:49.440 --> 14:51.440]  Paul de Man was teaching Lit Z.
[14:51.440 --> 14:55.440]  He was teaching a lecture course nearby,
[14:55.440 --> 15:01.440]  not at the same time, which was interpretation as
[15:01.440 --> 15:04.440]  practiced by the School of de Man.
[15:04.440 --> 15:05.440]  That was Lit Z.
[15:05.440 --> 15:09.440]  It did, indeed, imply every other form of
[15:09.440 --> 15:13.440]  theory, and it was extremely rigorous and interesting,
[15:13.440 --> 15:15.440]  but it wasn't a survey.
[15:15.440 --> 15:17.440]  It took for granted, in other words,
[15:17.440 --> 15:21.440]  that everything else would derive from the fundamental
[15:21.440 --> 15:24.440]  idea, but it didn't for a minute think
[15:24.440 --> 15:27.440]  that a whole series of fundamental ideas could share
[15:27.440 --> 15:30.440]  space, could be a kind of smorgasbord
[15:30.440 --> 15:34.440]  that you could mix and match in a kind of happy-go-lucky,
[15:34.440 --> 15:37.440]  eclectic way, which perhaps we will be
[15:37.440 --> 15:41.440]  seeming to do from time to time in our introductory course.
[15:41.440 --> 15:45.440]  Now, does one feel any nostalgia for the coolness and
[15:45.440 --> 15:47.440]  heat of this moment?
[15:47.440 --> 15:49.440]  Yes and no.
[15:49.440 --> 15:53.440]  It was fascinating to be, as Wordsworth says,
[15:53.440 --> 15:56.440]  bliss was it in that dawn to be alive.
[15:56.440 --> 16:00.440]  It was fascinating to be around in those days,
[16:00.440 --> 16:05.440]  but at the same time I think it's rather advantageous for us
[16:05.440 --> 16:07.440]  to be still in theory.
[16:07.440 --> 16:10.440]  That is to say, we still have views.
[16:10.440 --> 16:14.440]  We still have to recognize that what we think derives from this
[16:14.440 --> 16:18.440]  or that understanding of theory and these or those theoretical
[16:18.440 --> 16:19.440]  principles.
[16:19.440 --> 16:23.440]  We have to understand the way in which what we do and say,
[16:23.440 --> 16:25.440]  what we write in our papers and articles,
[16:25.440 --> 16:28.440]  is grounded in theoretical premises which,
[16:28.440 --> 16:30.440]  if we don't come to terms with them,
[16:30.440 --> 16:35.440]  we will simply naively reproduce without being fully aware of how
[16:35.440 --> 16:39.440]  we're using them and how indeed they're using us.
[16:39.440 --> 16:43.440]  So it is as crucial as ever to understand theory.
[16:43.440 --> 16:47.440]  At the same time, we have the vantage point of,
[16:47.440 --> 16:50.440]  I suppose, what we can now call history.
[16:50.440 --> 16:56.440]  Some of what we'll be studying is no longer practiced as that
[16:56.440 --> 17:01.440]  which is the absolutely necessary central path to
[17:01.440 --> 17:02.440]  methodology.
[17:02.440 --> 17:07.440]  Some of what we're studying has had its moment of flourishing,
[17:07.440 --> 17:11.440]  has remained influential as a paradigm that shapes other
[17:11.440 --> 17:14.440]  paradigms, but is not itself perhaps today
[17:14.440 --> 17:17.440]  the paradigm, which gives us the opportunity
[17:17.440 --> 17:21.440]  of historical perspective so that from time to time during the
[17:21.440 --> 17:25.440]  course of the course I'll be trying to say something about
[17:25.440 --> 17:29.440]  why certain theoretical issues and ideas pushed themselves into
[17:29.440 --> 17:32.440]  prominence at certain historical moments,
[17:32.440 --> 17:36.440]  and that too then can become part of our enterprise.
[17:36.440 --> 17:40.440]  So an introduction is not only valuable for those of us who
[17:40.440 --> 17:42.440]  simply wish to acquire knowledge.
[17:42.440 --> 17:45.440]  It's also valuable, I think, in lending an
[17:45.440 --> 17:49.440]  additional perspective to the topic of theory and to an
[17:49.440 --> 17:53.440]  understanding about how theory is on the one hand perhaps in a
[17:53.440 --> 17:56.440]  certain sense now an historical topic,
[17:56.440 --> 18:00.440]  and is on the other hand something that we're very much
[18:00.440 --> 18:03.440]  engaged in and still committed to.
[18:03.440 --> 18:08.440]  So all that then by way of rationale for teaching an
[18:08.440 --> 18:10.440]  introduction to theory.
[18:10.440 --> 18:11.440]  All right.
[18:11.440 --> 18:16.440]  Now the question, how does literary theory relate
[18:16.440 --> 18:20.440]  to the history of criticism?
[18:20.440 --> 18:23.440]  Now this is a course that I like to teach to.
[18:23.440 --> 18:26.440]  I usually teach it Plato to T.S.
[18:26.440 --> 18:28.440]  Eliot or Plato to I.A.
[18:28.440 --> 18:32.440]  Richards or some sort of important figure in the early
[18:32.440 --> 18:35.440]  20th century, and it's a course which is
[18:35.440 --> 18:38.440]  absolutely fascinating in all sorts of ways.
[18:38.440 --> 18:42.440]  It has one very important thing in common with literary theory.
- [18:42.440 --> 18:45.440]  That is to say, <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">literary criticism is too
[18:45.440 --> 18:50.440]  perpetually concerned with the definition of literature.
[18:50.440 --> 18:54.440]  Many of the issues that I raised in talking about defining
[18:54.440 --> 18:58.440]  literature are as relevant for literary criticism as they are
[18:58.440 --> 19:01.440]  for literary theory, and yet we all instinctively
[19:01.440 --> 19:06.440]  know that these are two very different enterprises.
[</mark>19:06.440 --> 19:10.440]  Literary theory loses something that literary criticism just
[19:10.440 --> 19:11.440]  takes for granted.
[19:11.440 --> 19:16.440]  Literary theory is not concerned with issues of
[19:16.440 --> 19:22.440]  evaluation, and it's not really concerned with concomitant
[19:22.440 --> 19:25.440]  issues of appreciation.
[19:25.440 --> 19:30.440]  Literary theory just takes those for granted as part of
[19:30.440 --> 19:34.440]  the sense experience, as one might say,
[19:34.440 --> 19:39.440]  of any reader and prefers rather to dwell on questions of
[19:39.440 --> 19:43.440]  description, analysis, and speculation,
[19:43.440 --> 19:44.440]  as I've said.
[19:44.440 --> 19:48.440]  Now that's what's lost in theory, but what's new in
[19:48.440 --> 19:52.440]  theory, and here I come to the topic which will occupy most of
[19:52.440 --> 19:55.440]  my attention for the remainder of the lecture.
[19:55.440 --> 19:59.440]  What's new in theory is the element of skepticism that
[19:59.440 --> 20:02.440]  literary criticism by and large,
[20:02.440 --> 20:06.440]  which is usually affirming a canon of some sort,
[20:06.440 --> 20:08.440]  doesn't reflect.
[20:08.440 --> 20:10.440]  Literary theory, as I say,
[20:10.440 --> 20:14.440]  is skeptical about the foundations of its subject
[20:14.440 --> 20:19.440]  matter and also in many cases about the foundations of what it
[20:19.440 --> 20:21.440]  itself is doing.
[20:21.440 --> 20:24.440]  So the question is, how on earth did this come
[20:24.440 --> 20:25.440]  about?
[20:25.440 --> 20:27.440]  It's an historical question, as I say,
[20:27.440 --> 20:31.440]  and I want to devote the rest of the lecture to it.
[20:31.440 --> 20:36.440]  Why should doubt about the veridical[^2] or truth-affirming
[20:36.440 --> 20:42.440]  possibilities of interpretation be so widespread in the
[20:42.440 --> 20:44.440]  twentieth century?
[20:44.440 --> 20:49.440]  Now here a big glop of intellectual history.
[20:49.440 --> 20:53.440]  I think it arises from what one might call and what often is
[20:53.440 --> 20:56.440]  called modernity, not to be confused with
[20:56.440 --> 20:59.440]  modernism and early twentieth-century phenomenon,
[20:59.440 --> 21:03.440]  but the history of modern thought as it usually derives
[21:03.440 --> 21:06.440]  from the generation of Descartes,
[21:06.440 --> 21:08.440]  Shakespeare, and Cervantes.
[21:08.440 --> 21:10.440]  Notice something about all of those figures.
[21:10.440 --> 21:14.440]  Shakespeare is preoccupied with figures who may or may not be
[21:14.440 --> 21:15.440]  crazy.
[21:15.440 --> 21:20.440]  Cervantes is preoccupied with a figure who is crazy.
[21:20.440 --> 21:23.440]  We're pretty sure of that, but he certainly isn't.
[21:23.440 --> 21:28.440]  He takes it for granted that he is the most rational and
[21:28.440 --> 21:33.440]  systematic of all thinkers and raises questions about,
[21:33.440 --> 21:36.440]  since we all take ourselves to be rational too,
[21:36.440 --> 21:41.440]  just how we know ourselves not to be paranoid delusives like
[21:41.440 --> 21:42.440]  Don Quixote.
[21:42.440 --> 21:46.440]  So that too can be unsettling when we think of this as
[21:46.440 --> 21:50.440]  happening at a certain contemporaneous[^3] moment in the
[21:50.440 --> 21:52.440]  history of thought.
[21:52.440 --> 21:54.440]  Now Descartes, you remember,
[21:54.440 --> 21:57.440]  in his Meditations, begins by asking a series of
[21:57.440 --> 22:00.440]  questions about how he can know anything.
[22:00.440 --> 22:03.440]  One of the skeptical questions he asks is,
[22:03.440 --> 22:05.440]  well, might I not be crazy?
[22:05.440 --> 22:08.440]  In other words, Descartes is still thinking along
[22:08.440 --> 22:09.440]  these same lines.
[22:09.440 --> 22:13.440]  He says, well, maybe I've been seized by an evil genius of some
[22:13.440 --> 22:15.440]  kind, or maybe I'm just crazy.
[22:15.440 --> 22:17.440]  Now why, and here's the question,
[22:17.440 --> 22:21.440]  why do we get this nervousness about the relationship between
[22:21.440 --> 22:27.440]  what I know and how I know it arising at this moment?
[22:27.440 --> 22:29.440]  Well, I think it's characterized,
[22:29.440 --> 22:32.440]  at least in part, by what Descartes goes on to
[22:32.440 --> 22:34.440]  say in his Meditations.
[22:34.440 --> 22:38.440]  Descartes settles the matter, perhaps somewhat sweeping the
[22:38.440 --> 22:42.440]  question whether he's crazy under the rug because I'm still
[22:42.440 --> 22:44.440]  not sure he answers that question,
[22:44.440 --> 22:47.440]  but he settles the matter famously by saying,
[22:47.440 --> 22:49.440]  I think therefore I am.
[22:49.440 --> 22:51.440]  Furthermore, as a concomitant,
[22:51.440 --> 22:55.440]  I think therefore all the things that I'm thinking about
[22:55.440 --> 22:58.440]  can be understood to exist as well.
[22:58.440 --> 23:03.440]  Now the Cartesian Revolution establishes something that is
[23:03.440 --> 23:07.440]  absolutely crucial for what we call the enlightenment of the
[23:07.440 --> 23:09.440]  next hundred, hundred fifty years.
[23:09.440 --> 23:11.440]  In other words, the idea that there is a
[23:11.440 --> 23:14.440]  distance between the mind and the things that it thinks about,
[23:14.440 --> 23:17.440]  but that this distance is a good thing.
[23:17.440 --> 23:20.440]  In other words, if you look too closely at a
[23:20.440 --> 23:23.440]  picture or if you stand too far away from it,
[23:23.440 --> 23:25.440]  you don't see it clearly.
[23:25.440 --> 23:26.440]  It's out of focus.
[23:26.440 --> 23:29.440]  But if you achieve just the right distance from it,
[23:29.440 --> 23:31.440]  it comes into focus.
[23:31.440 --> 23:34.440]  The idea of scientific objectivity,
[23:34.440 --> 23:37.440]  the idea that motivates the creation of the great
[23:37.440 --> 23:41.440]  Encyclopedia by the figures of the French Enlightenment,
[23:41.440 --> 23:46.440]  this idea all arises out of the idea that there is a certain
[23:46.440 --> 23:51.440]  appropriate objective distance between the perceiver and the
[23:51.440 --> 23:52.440]  perceived.
[23:52.440 --> 23:55.440]  Gradually, however, the idea that this
[23:55.440 --> 23:59.440]  distance is not too great begins to erode,
[23:59.440 --> 24:03.440]  so that in 1796 Kant, who isn't exactly enlisted on
[24:03.440 --> 24:07.440]  the side of the skeptics by most of his serious students,
[24:07.440 --> 24:12.440]  nevertheless does say something equally famous as that which
[24:12.440 --> 24:16.440]  Descartes said and a good deal more disturbing.
- [24:16.440 --> 24:20.440]<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">  We cannot know the thing in itself.</mark>
[24:20.440 --> 24:23.440]  Now as I said, Kant erected such an incredibly
[24:23.440 --> 24:27.440]  magnificent scaffolding around the thing in itself,
[24:27.440 --> 24:30.440]  that is to say, the variety of ways in which
[24:30.440 --> 24:33.440]  although we can't know it, we can sort of triangulate it
[24:33.440 --> 24:35.440]  and come to terms with it obliquely[^4],
[24:35.440 --> 24:39.440]  that it seems churlish[^5] to enlist him on the side of the
[24:39.440 --> 24:40.440]  skeptics.
[24:40.440 --> 24:44.440]  But at the same time there's a sense of a danger in the
[24:44.440 --> 24:49.440]  distance between subject and object that begins to emerge in
[24:49.440 --> 24:51.440]  thinking of this kind.
[24:51.440 --> 24:56.440]  Now by 1807 Hegel in The Phenomenology of Mind is saying
[24:56.440 --> 25:00.440]  that in recent history and in recent developments of
[25:00.440 --> 25:04.440]  consciousness something unfortunate has set in.
[25:04.440 --> 25:09.440]  We have unhappy consciousness, which is the result of
[25:09.440 --> 25:14.440]  estrangement and Verfremdung, which drives us too far away
[25:14.440 --> 25:18.440]  from the thing that we're looking at.
[25:18.440 --> 25:22.440]  We are no longer certain at all of what we're looking at,
[25:22.440 --> 25:26.440]  and consciousness therefore feels alienated.
[25:26.440 --> 25:27.440]  All right.
[25:27.440 --> 25:31.440]  So you can already begin to see a development in intellectual
[25:31.440 --> 25:35.440]  thought that perhaps opens the way to a certain skepticism,
[25:35.440 --> 25:38.440]  but the crucial thing hasn't yet happened,
[25:38.440 --> 25:41.440]  because after all in all these accounts,
[25:41.440 --> 25:44.440]  even that of Hegel, there's no doubt about the
[25:44.440 --> 25:48.440]  authority of consciousness to think what it thinks.
[25:48.440 --> 25:52.440]  It may not clearly think about things, about objects,
[25:52.440 --> 25:57.440]  but it has a kind of legitimate basis that generates the sort of
[25:57.440 --> 25:59.440]  thinking that it does.
[25:59.440 --> 26:03.440]  But then, and here's where I want you to look at the passages
[26:03.440 --> 26:06.440]  that I've handed out, here's where three great
[26:06.440 --> 26:10.440]  figures, there are others but these are considered the seminal[^6]
[26:10.440 --> 26:13.440]  figures, begin to raise questions which
[26:13.440 --> 26:16.440]  complicate the whole issue of consciousness.
[26:16.440 --> 26:20.440]  Their argument is it's not just that consciousness doesn't
[26:20.440 --> 26:23.440]  clearly understand what it's looking at.
[26:23.440 --> 26:27.440]  It's also, and is therefore alienated from it,
[26:27.440 --> 26:32.440]  that consciousness is alienated from its own underpinnings[^7],
[26:32.440 --> 26:36.440]  that it doesn't have any clear sense of where it's coming from
[26:36.440 --> 26:39.440]  any more than what it's looking at.
[26:39.440 --> 26:42.440]  In other words, that consciousness is not only
[26:42.440 --> 26:46.440]  estranged from the world but that it is in and of itself
[26:46.440 --> 26:47.440]  inauthentic.
[26:47.440 --> 26:50.440]  So let's just quickly look at these passages.
[26:50.440 --> 26:55.440]  Marx in the famous argument about commodity fetishism in
[26:55.440 --> 27:00.440]  the Bible is comparing the way in which we take the product of
[27:00.440 --> 27:04.440]  human labor and turn it into a commodity by saying that it has
[27:04.440 --> 27:07.440]  objective value, by saying that we know what
[27:07.440 --> 27:09.440]  its value is in and of itself.
[27:09.440 --> 27:12.440]  He compares that with religion.
[27:12.440 --> 27:15.440]  The argument is, well, God is a product of
[27:15.440 --> 27:16.440]  human labor.
[27:16.440 --> 27:18.440]  In other words, it's not a completely
[27:18.440 --> 27:19.440]  supercilious[^8] argument.
[27:19.440 --> 27:24.440]  God is brought into being the same way objects that we make use
[27:24.440 --> 27:26.440]  of are brought into being.
[27:26.440 --> 27:28.440]  God is a product of human labor.
[27:28.440 --> 27:33.440]  But then we turn around and we say God exists and has value
[27:33.440 --> 27:34.440]  objectively.
[27:34.440 --> 27:41.440]  Marx's argument is that the two forms of belief in the objective
[27:41.440 --> 27:47.440]  value of the commodity and belief in God are the same.
[27:47.440 --> 27:50.440]  Now whether or not any of this is true,
[27:50.440 --> 27:52.440]  believe me, is neither here nor there.
[27:52.440 --> 27:59.440]  The point that Marx is making is that consciousness,
[27:59.440 --> 28:02.440]  that is to say, the way in which we believe
[28:02.440 --> 28:07.440]  things, is determined by factors outside its control.
[28:07.440 --> 28:10.440]  That is to say, in the case of Marx's
[28:10.440 --> 28:13.440]  arguments, social, historical and economic
[28:13.440 --> 28:18.440]  factors that determine what we think and which in general we
[28:18.440 --> 28:20.440]  call ideology.
[28:20.440 --> 28:24.440]  That is to say, ideology is driven by
[28:24.440 --> 28:31.440]  factors beyond the ken[^9] of the person who thinks ideologically.
[28:31.440 --> 28:34.440]  So you see the problem for consciousness now is not just a
[28:34.440 --> 28:35.440]  single problem.
[28:35.440 --> 28:36.440]  It's twofold.
[28:36.440 --> 28:40.440]  It's its inauthentic relationship with the things it
[28:40.440 --> 28:44.440]  looks at and also its inauthentic relationship with
[28:44.440 --> 28:46.440]  its own underpinnings.
[28:46.440 --> 28:49.440]  The argument is exactly the same for Nietzsche only he shifts
[28:49.440 --> 28:51.440]  the ground of attack.
[28:51.440 --> 28:53.440]  For Nietzsche, the underpinnings of
[28:53.440 --> 28:57.440]  consciousness which make the operations of consciousness
[28:57.440 --> 29:01.440]  inauthentic are the nature of language itself.
[29:01.440 --> 29:05.440]  That is to say that when we think we're telling the truth,
[29:05.440 --> 29:09.440]  we're actually using worn-out figures of speech.
[29:09.440 --> 29:11.440]  What then is truth?
[29:11.440 --> 29:14.440]  A mobile army of metaphors, metonomies,
[29:14.440 --> 29:17.440]  anthropomorphisms, in short, a sum of human
[29:17.440 --> 29:20.440]  relations which became poetically and rhetorically
[29:20.440 --> 29:23.440]  intensified, etc., etc., etc.,
[29:23.440 --> 29:29.440]  and are now no longer of account as coins but are debased.
[29:29.440 --> 29:32.440]  Now that word now is very important.
[29:32.440 --> 29:35.440]  It suggests that Nietzsche does somehow believe that there's a
[29:35.440 --> 29:39.440]  privileged moment in the history of language when perhaps language
[29:39.440 --> 29:42.440]  is a truth serum, when it is capable of telling
[29:42.440 --> 29:43.440]  the truth.
[29:43.440 --> 29:48.440]  But language has now simply become a question of worn-out
[29:48.440 --> 29:52.440]  figures, all of which dictates what we
[29:52.440 --> 29:54.440]  believe to be true.
[29:54.440 --> 29:59.440]  I speak in a figurative way about the relationship between
[29:59.440 --> 30:04.440]  the earth and the sky, and I believe that there's a
[30:04.440 --> 30:05.440]  sky god.
[30:05.440 --> 30:10.440]  I speak because I simply don't believe that I'm using figures
[30:10.440 --> 30:11.440]  of speech.
[30:11.440 --> 30:14.440]  All of this is implied in Nietzsche's argument.
[30:14.440 --> 30:17.440]  In other words, language, the nature of
[30:17.440 --> 30:21.440]  language, the way language is received by us in turn
[30:21.440 --> 30:25.440]  determines what we can do with it, which is to say,
[30:25.440 --> 30:29.440]  determines what we think, so that for Nietzsche the
[30:29.440 --> 30:32.440]  distortion of truth, that is to say,
[30:32.440 --> 30:37.440]  the distortion of the power to observe in consciousness has as
[30:37.440 --> 30:41.440]  its underlying cause language, the state of language,
[30:41.440 --> 30:43.440]  the status of language.
[30:43.440 --> 30:47.440]  Freud finally argues for exactly the same relationship
[30:47.440 --> 30:50.440]  between consciousness, that is to say,
[30:50.440 --> 30:54.440]  what I think I am thinking from minute to minute,
[30:54.440 --> 30:58.440]  and the unconscious, which perpetually in one way or
[30:58.440 --> 31:02.440]  another unsettles what I'm thinking and saying from minute
[31:02.440 --> 31:03.440]  to minute.
[31:03.440 --> 31:06.440]  You know that in the psychopathology of everyday life
[31:06.440 --> 31:09.440]  Freud reminded us that the Freudian slip isn't something
[31:09.440 --> 31:13.440]  that happens just sometimes, and nobody knows this better
[31:13.440 --> 31:14.440]  than a lecturer.
[31:14.440 --> 31:17.440]  It's something that happens all the time,
[31:17.440 --> 31:21.440]  and the Freudian slip is something that one lives with
[31:21.440 --> 31:26.440]  simply as a phenomenon of the slippage of consciousness under
[31:26.440 --> 31:29.440]  the influence of the unconscious.
[31:29.440 --> 31:33.440]  Now in the passage I gave you Freud says a very interesting
[31:33.440 --> 31:37.440]  thing, which is that after all we have absolutely no objective
[31:37.440 --> 31:40.440]  evidence that the unconscious exists.
[31:40.440 --> 31:44.440]  If I could see the unconscious it would be conscious,
[31:44.440 --> 31:45.440]  right?
[31:45.440 --> 31:47.440]  The unconscious, Freud is saying,
[31:47.440 --> 31:51.440]  is something that we have to infer from the way consciousness
[31:51.440 --> 31:52.440]  operates.
[31:52.440 --> 31:54.440]  We've got to infer something.
[31:54.440 --> 31:58.440]  We've got to figure out somehow how it is that consciousness is
[31:58.440 --> 32:02.440]  never completely inhibited, never completely does and says
[32:02.440 --> 32:04.440]  what it wants to say.
[32:04.440 --> 32:10.440]  So the spin on consciousness for Freud is the unconscious.
[32:10.440 --> 32:14.440]  Now someone who didn't fully believe Marx,
[32:14.440 --> 32:17.440]  Nietzsche, and Freud, a very important modern
[32:17.440 --> 32:21.440]  philosopher in the hermeneutic tradition named Paul Ricoeur,
[32:21.440 --> 32:25.440]  famously said in the first passage on your sheet that these
[32:25.440 --> 32:28.440]  great precursors of modern thought,
[32:28.440 --> 32:32.440]  and particularly, I would immediately add,
[32:32.440 --> 32:38.440]  of modern literary theory, together dominate a school of
[32:38.440 --> 32:39.440]  suspicion.
[32:39.440 --> 32:43.440]  There is, in other words, in Ricoeur's view,
[32:43.440 --> 32:48.440]  a hermeneutics of suspicion, and skepticism or suspicion is
[32:48.440 --> 32:52.440]  a word that can also be appropriated perhaps more
[32:52.440 --> 32:56.440]  rigorously for philosophy as negativity.
[32:56.440 --> 32:59.440]  That is to say, whatever seems manifest or
[32:59.440 --> 33:04.440]  obvious or patent in what we're looking at is undermined for
[33:04.440 --> 33:09.440]  this kind of mind by a negation which is counterintuitive,
[33:09.440 --> 33:13.440]  that is to say, which would seem not just to
[33:13.440 --> 33:18.440]  qualify what we understand ourselves to be looking at but
[33:18.440 --> 33:21.440]  to undermine it altogether.
[33:21.440 --> 33:25.440]  These tendencies in the way in which Marx,
[33:25.440 --> 33:27.440]  Nietzsche, and Freud have been received,
[33:27.440 --> 33:30.440]  and when we read Foucault's What is an Author next time,
[33:30.440 --> 33:33.440]  we'll return to this question of how Marx,
[33:33.440 --> 33:37.440]  Nietzsche, and Freud have been received and what we should make
[33:37.440 --> 33:40.440]  of that in view of Foucault's idea that there's not that
[33:40.440 --> 33:43.440]  there's no such thing as an author but that it's rather
[33:43.440 --> 33:46.440]  dangerous to believe that there are authors.
[33:46.440 --> 33:48.440]  Well, if it's dangerous to believe that there are authors,
[33:48.440 --> 33:50.440]  what about Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud?
[33:50.440 --> 33:54.440]  Foucault confronts this question in What is an Author
[33:54.440 --> 33:58.440]  and gives us some interesting results of his thinking.
[33:58.440 --> 34:03.440]  For us, the aftermath, even precisely of the passages
[34:03.440 --> 34:09.440]  I've just quoted but certainly of the erve of the three authors
[34:09.440 --> 34:14.440]  I've quoted from, can to a large degree be
[34:14.440 --> 34:19.440]  understood as accounting for the topic,
[34:19.440 --> 34:22.440]  the phenomenon of literary theory as we study it.
[34:22.440 --> 34:24.440]  In other words, literary theory,
[34:24.440 --> 34:27.440]  because of the influence of these figures,
[34:27.440 --> 34:33.440]  is to a considerable degree a hermeneutics of suspicion
[34:33.440 --> 34:38.440]  recognized as such both by its proponents and,
[34:38.440 --> 34:42.440]  famously, I think this is perhaps what is historical for
[34:42.440 --> 34:44.440]  you, by its enemies.
[34:44.440 --> 34:48.440]  During the same period when I was first teaching this course,
[34:48.440 --> 34:53.440]  a veritable six-foot shelf of diatribes[^10] against literary
[34:53.440 --> 34:57.440]  theory was being written in the public sphere.
[34:57.440 --> 35:02.440]  You can take or leave literary theory.
[35:02.440 --> 35:03.440]  Fine.
[35:03.440 --> 35:06.440]  But the idea that there would be such an incredible outcry
[35:06.440 --> 35:10.440]  against it was one of the most fascinating results of it.
[35:10.440 --> 35:12.440]  That is to say, for many,
[35:12.440 --> 35:15.440]  many, many people, literary theory had something
[35:15.440 --> 35:18.440]  to do with the end of civilization as we know it.
[35:18.440 --> 35:22.440]  That's one of the things that seems rather strange to us today
[35:22.440 --> 35:24.440]  from an historical perspective.
[35:24.440 --> 35:28.440]  But the undermining of foundational knowledge,
[35:28.440 --> 35:32.440]  which seemed to be part and parcel of so much that went on
[35:32.440 --> 35:36.440]  in literary theory, was seen as the central,
[35:36.440 --> 35:42.440]  crucial threat to rationality emanating from the academy and
[35:42.440 --> 35:48.440]  was attacked in those terms in, as I say,
[35:48.440 --> 35:53.440]  at least six feet of lively polemics.
[35:53.440 --> 35:57.440]  All of that is the legacy of literary theory,
[35:57.440 --> 36:00.440]  and as I say, it arises in part from this
[36:00.440 --> 36:05.440]  element of skepticism that I thought it best to emphasize
[36:05.440 --> 36:06.440]  today.
[36:06.440 --> 36:11.440]  Now I think that one thing Recur leaves out and something that
[36:11.440 --> 36:16.440]  we can anticipate as becoming more and more important for
[36:16.440 --> 36:21.440]  literary theory and other kinds of theory in the twentieth
[36:21.440 --> 36:23.440]  century is Darwin.
[36:23.440 --> 36:27.440]  That is to say, it strikes me that Darwin could
[36:27.440 --> 36:33.440]  very easily be considered a fourth hermeneut of suspicion.
[36:33.440 --> 36:37.440]  Of course, Darwin was not interested in suspicion,
[36:37.440 --> 36:41.440]  but he was certainly the founder of ways of thinking about
[36:41.440 --> 36:44.440]  consciousness that are determined,
[36:44.440 --> 36:48.440]  sociobiologically determined, determined in the realm of
[36:48.440 --> 36:51.440]  cognitive science, determined as artificial
[36:51.440 --> 36:53.440]  intelligence, and so on.
[36:53.440 --> 36:57.440]  All of this is Darwinian thinking and I think increasingly
[36:57.440 --> 37:02.440]  will be central in importance in the twenty-first century.
[37:02.440 --> 37:08.440]  What will alter the shape of literary theory as it was known
[37:08.440 --> 37:12.440]  and studied in the twentieth century is,
[37:12.440 --> 37:16.440]  I think, an increasing emphasis on cognitive science and
[37:16.440 --> 37:20.440]  sociobiological approaches both to literature and to
[37:20.440 --> 37:25.440]  interpretive processes that will derive from Darwin in the same
[37:25.440 --> 37:29.440]  way that strands of thinking of the twentieth century derive
[37:29.440 --> 37:32.440]  from the three figures that I've mentioned.
[37:32.440 --> 37:37.440]  But what all this gives rise to, and this brings me finally to
[37:37.440 --> 37:41.440]  the passages which you have on both sides of your sheet and
[37:41.440 --> 37:45.440]  which I don't want to take up today but just to preview,
[37:45.440 --> 37:48.440]  the passages from James Ambassadors,
[37:48.440 --> 37:52.440]  1903, and from Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard,
[37:52.440 --> 37:53.440]  1904.
[37:53.440 --> 37:56.440]  In other words, I'm at pains to remind you
[37:56.440 --> 38:00.440]  that this is a specific historical moment in which,
[38:00.440 --> 38:04.440]  in a variety of ways, the speaker argues that
[38:04.440 --> 38:07.440]  consciousness, that is to say,
[38:07.440 --> 38:12.440]  the feeling of being alive and being someone acting in the
[38:12.440 --> 38:15.440]  world, no longer involves agency.
[38:15.440 --> 38:21.440]  The feeling that somehow to be conscious has become to be a
[38:21.440 --> 38:26.440]  puppet, that there is a limitation on what we can do
[38:26.440 --> 38:31.440]  imposed by the idea that consciousness is determined in
[38:31.440 --> 38:37.440]  ways that we cannot control and cannot get the better of,
[38:37.440 --> 38:41.440]  so that Strasser and the Ambassadors and
[38:41.440 --> 38:47.440]  Yepikhodov in The Cherry Orchard speak for a point of view which
[38:47.440 --> 38:52.440]  is a kind of partially well-informed gloom and doom that
[38:52.440 --> 38:57.440]  could be understood to pervade texts that are much better
[38:57.440 --> 39:01.440]  informed that we will be considering but nevertheless
[39:01.440 --> 39:05.440]  are especially important as an aspect of their historical
[39:05.440 --> 39:06.440]  moment.
[39:06.440 --> 39:09.440]  I want to begin the next lecture by taking up those
[39:09.440 --> 39:10.440]  passages.
[39:10.440 --> 39:14.440]  Please do bring them, and I will also be passing
[39:14.440 --> 39:18.440]  around Tony the Tow Truck, and I'll give you a brief
[39:18.440 --> 39:22.440]  description of what the little children's book actually looks
[39:22.440 --> 39:24.440]  like, and then we will plunge into
[39:24.440 --> 39:26.440]  the question, what is an author?
[39:26.440 --> 39:28.440]  So I'll see you on Thursday.
