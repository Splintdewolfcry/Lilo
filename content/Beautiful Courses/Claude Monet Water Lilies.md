> ### While Claude Monet’s _Water Lilies_ may appear to be largely abstract, they reflect a fidelity to nature stemming from his careful observations of his beloved garden outside of his Giverny studio. This elaborate garden (requiring six full-time gardeners to maintain) featured a Japanese-style lily pond, which became the subject of a series of paintings that the artist worked on over the course of many months, and sometimes years. In them, he aimed to convey the sensation of water without end. He filled his enveloping canvases from edge-to-edge with layered color and brushstrokes, capturing his perception of the water lilies, the play of sunlight and shadow, and the reflections of the sky, clouds, and garden surroundings on the pond’s ever-changing surface. His impressionistic approach to rendering the real world in paint foregrounds light and color, which he used to model his flower-dotted waterscapes.
